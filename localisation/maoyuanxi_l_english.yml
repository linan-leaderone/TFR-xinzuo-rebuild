rev_canxiang_desc: "--------------\n§YAs the only survivor of the Lin-Jiang case, Mao Yuanxin embodies not only the embers of the revolutionary era but also carries a deep-seated obsession with its legacy. He is the 'echo' of the revolution, a reminder to the people that the ghost of the revolution is never far away.§!\n--------------"
PRC_mao_yuanxin: "Mao Yuanxin"

PRC_mao_yuanxin_DESC: "Mao Yuanxin, nephew of Mao Zedong, was born in 1941 and belongs to a prominent family within the Chinese Communist Party. His political career has seen many ups and downs, deeply intertwined with the Cultural Revolution. During that period, Mao Yuanxin was entrusted with significant responsibilities as the Secretary of the Liaoning Provincial Party Committee. As a young Red Guard leader, he took on the mantle of 'revolutionary successor,' enacting Mao's radical policies in Northeast China, and gradually building his influence within the Party.\n\nHowever, after the end of the Cultural Revolution, Mao Yuanxin’s fate took a dramatic turn. Following the fall of the Gang of Four, he was accused of participating in extreme leftist activities and purged, ultimately being imprisoned. To some, Mao Yuanxin represented the young leftist generation, and his downfall symbolized the end of Mao’s ultra-leftist path. After the death of Jiang Tengjiao on May 8, 2009, Mao Yuanxin became the last surviving participant of the Lin Biao-Jiang Qing Counter-Revolutionary Group case. Although he no longer holds influence, he remains a steadfast follower of Maoist ideology in the 21st century, opposing China's return to capitalism.\n\nToday, Mao Yuanxin leads a new wave of 'little red guards' and has reclaimed power in a revival of red ideals. He raises the banner of 'anti-revisionism,' advocating a return to Mao’s core principles, aiming to reshape the nation with an emphasis on class struggle and opposition to bureaucratic privilege. Despite his age, Mao Yuanxin is determined to paint this faded land red once again.\n\n§RRevolution is justified; rebellion is reasonable!§!"
rev_houdai: "Red Descendant"

rev_houdai_desc: "--------------\n§YFor many, the extreme left may be something to keep at a distance, yet Mao’s status as 'Chairman Mao’s nephew' has won him a wider base of public and Party support. This unique identity endows him with a sacred revolutionary heritage, dampening opposition and easing the path for reforms. He is not only a political leader but also seen as the living extension of Mao’s spirit. This red lineage brings a unique influence and an unshakeable authority to his leadership.\n\n§ROnly time will tell whether this spontaneous personal worship is a blessing or a curse for China...§!§!\n--------------"
