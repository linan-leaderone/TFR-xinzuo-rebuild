 UNIT_MOT_MILITIA: "§WMotorized Militia £unit_mot_militia_icon_small :Cheaper alternative to regluar motorized. Higher organization, but lower HP. Requires Infantry Equipment, Motorized Equipment, Anti-Air and Anti Anti-Tank Equipment and Armored ATGMs"

 UNIT_COMPANIES: "§WMBT Company, APC Company, SPA Company, and SPAA Company are the 4 new support companies. Their use and equipment requirements are self explanitory."
 GENERAL_BALANCE: "§WCombat in §!§CThe Fire Rises§! §Wworks similar to §!§CMillennium Dawn§!, §Wwith some added tweaks.

 ABT_MOD: "The Fire Rises is a mod set in our time of January 1st, 2020. There is nothing here to view as of the start that is different from our current timeline, but it will come at a later day in your game. The Fire Rises (Or TFR for short) is a mod that makes great use of the decisions tab (Paradox's greatest blessing to modders), focus trees, and events. It is very important to keep up with these as without them your game will not function as intended and you probably lose/fail your game, so make sure to pay attention.\n\n\nWe have poured our heart and soul into making this mod and we hope you can enjoy the fruits of our hard labor."

 ABT_MONEY: "§WThe system is simple, yet it has a lot of depth.\nYou will add §GIncome§! and subtract §RExpenses§! monthly."
 ABT_MONEY_2: "In The Fire Rises, Real §GGDP§! is a key measure of economic strength, representing Nominal §GGDP§! adjusted for £inflation Inflation-providing a clearer picture of the actual economy. Real §GGDP§! is essential for understanding the §YDebt-to-GDP Ratio§! since high §RDebt§! relative to Real §GGDP§! indicates potential economic §Rinstability§!. Real §GGDP§! is calculated by summing §YBusiness Value§!, §YPersonal Value§!, §YSocial Spending§!, §YMilitary Spending§!, and §YExports§!, then §Rsubtracting§! §YImports§!. This yearly total is adjusted for £inflation Inflation to reflect the true economic output of the nation.\n\n£inflation Inflation refers to the rise in general price levels in the national economy, which erodes purchasing power. £inflation Inflation is influenced by §YInterest Rate§! Laws and changes in the money supply. Managing £inflation Inflation is crucial, as high £inflation Inflation results in economic hardship and penalties, while £inflation Deflation can cause further setbacks.\n\n§RDebt§! represents the government's liabilities. When the country faces a monthly §Rdeficit§! and lacks enough §CLiquidity§!-the reserve funds available for immediate use-§RDebt§! rises. This §RDebt§! must be managed carefully; if the §YDebt-to-GDP Ratio§! exceeds a certain threshold, debuffs occur due to reduced investor confidence. Keeping §RDebt§! under control improves Stability and encourages national prosperity. You can pay off §RDebt§! automatically via \"Auto Payment\" or by directly paying them off in the §Y\"Economy and Trade\"§! tab.\n\nThe §YInterest Rate§! affects monthly §RDebt§! Payments and is a critical component of §RExpenses§!. A higher rate raises the cost of §RDebt§!, making it essential to monitor and manage to avoid unmanageable payments and instability.\n\n§CLiquidity§! is the reserve money available for immediate §Rexpenditures§! gained through taxation, vital for §YMilitary Upkeep§! (§YArmy§!, §YNavy§!, §YAirforce§!, and §YMilitary Industry§!), and §YSocial Spending§!. If §CLiquidity§! falls below zero, expenses are added to §RDebt§!, which must be repaid.\n\n£development Development changes every month based on modifiers, or it can be §Gincreased§! or §Rdecreased§! through §YFocuses§! and §YDecisions§!. If £development Development reachs §G100%§!, it will go §Gup§! one level, and §Rreduce§! the £development Development by §G100%§!. If the £development Development reaches §R-100%§!, it will go §Rdown§! one level, and §Gincrease§! the £development Development by §G100%§!. £development Development is §Gimportant§! to make sure each part of your country is as §Gstrong as possible§!.\n\n§YPower Plants§!, §YEnergy Farms§!, and §YNuclear Reactors§! are types of buildings known as §Y\"Power Plants\"§! which allow you to gain various §Gstate bonuses§! and are the main way to §Gincrease§! your §GBuilding Slots§! in a state, as §YIndustrial Techs§! no longer do so. However, each type of §YPower Plant§! is §Rmutually exclusive§! with eachother, and §Rcannot be built in the same state§!, so you'll need to strategize your placement of them.\n\nThe list of variables determining your §GIncome§! and §RExpenses§! can be found ingame by looking at the §Y\"Economy and Trade\"§! tab."
 ABT_MONEY_3: "§WAs stated this system is fairly simple to grasp. Larger nations (except the United States) should have no problem managing their economy. Most changes done to this mod were made so that smaller nations wouldn't be stuck in the negatives for the entirety of the game."
 ABT_MONEY_4: "§YThe People's Republic of China§! §WIs one of the biggest nations to use the money system. Battling COVID, helping other nations, finding a cure, and other operations require the use of most of your money. Though should you mismanage your funds and the nation fall to the mercy of the virus... Let's hope it doesn't get to that."
 ABT_MONEY_5: "§WIf playing as one of the minor factions in the §R Second American Civil War§! Purchasing firearms is your only saving grace. Most factions will not have §Ycivilian§! or §Ymilitary§! factories for the majority of the war if at all. The money you make should be used on buying equipment for your units. Note that not all equipment is available to purchase and some are of lesser quality. You can buy over 1500 §YPA Lutys§! for dirt cheap, but they aren't going to last long in the field... Where does your money go to? Who's supplying these weapons? That's a trade secret."

PRC_country_summary: "§YCountry Overview§!:\nFor China, an ancient country with a history of repeating cycles, the past 100 years have been both a bloody and tearful struggle for freedom and equality, as well as a process where power struggles have repeatedly pushed the nation into the abyss. In the first 50 years, China emerged from the chaos of the collapse of the feudal imperial system, attempting to seek independence and liberation through revolution, but paid a painful price with foreign invasions and internal strife; in the second 50 years, from the soaring heights of the proletarian revolution to the betrayal of revisionism, the people once again fell into oppression and exploitation after a brief moment of hope.\n\nNow, two decades have passed in the 21st century, and the combination of oligarchic capitalism and neo-authoritarianism has made the country seemingly prosperous on the surface, but in reality, it is riddled with crises. Some call this the peak of 'restoration,' while others believe that a new people's movement will overthrow the decaying system and rebuild a China truly belonging to the people.

However, it would soon face a myriad of challenges, many of which it was ill-prepared to confront.

Instead, it found itself navigating an increasingly complex global landscape that seemed to challenge its traditional role and influence. \nAs the nation grapples with a growing divide between its liberal urban centers and conservative rural communities, and whispers of a new virus emerging in Wuhan began to circulate, France enters the new decade unaware of the new role they will soon have in the concert of Europe, challenging Zbigniew Brzezinski's famous quote: \n\n\"There is an element of delusional obsession in the French political elite's preoccupation with the notion that France is still a global power.\""

Thanks to privatization, political connections and corruption, they were able to amass huge fortunes and build real business empires. In the Putin era, they retained their influence, adapting to the new reality: some joined state projects, while others used their capitals to further enrich themselves through commodity monopolies."

They quickly found ways to become part of the new Russian government through corruption and connections.\nTheir influence was felt everywhere, including in the Kremlin hall, like in the early 1990s. Now, they have privatized state resources and built their own media and economic empires. However, not everyone is happy with the idea of \"good\" oligarchs replacing \"bad\" ones. Their rule is facing opposition from politicians who oppose monopolies."
