PRC_MAO.103.t:0 "The End of the Day"
PRC_MAO.103.d:0 "The evening glow lazily spread across the slightly aged exterior of the electronics factory, casting a faint golden hue over everything. After the day shift ended, Xiao Zhang saw the long line ahead of him, stepping with a slightly heavy pace, walking through the long corridor towards the factory cafeteria. The sound of footsteps echoed through the empty factory, tinged with a subtle sense of solitude.\n\nFinally, he reached the cafeteria. Normally, the place was filled with the aroma of rice soup and the chatter of workers, some low and some high-pitched. But today, the air seemed to carry an unusual heaviness. Xiao Zhang joined the line, his gaze inadvertently sweeping across the food counter, and he couldn't help but be slightly startled. Tonight’s dinner was unusually lavish: steaming white rice, accompanied by hearty braised pork, steamed fish, sweet and sour pork, and even a rare fruit platter, everything contrasting sharply with the usual sparse cafeteria meals he remembered.\n\nConfusion like thin mist lingered in Xiao Zhang’s mind, and he looked around to find that most of his colleagues’ faces were also filled with disbelief and surprise. As they whispered among themselves, wondering if there was some hidden secret behind this unexpected “feast,” the cafeteria doors slowly opened, and a familiar yet distant figure stepped in under the gaze of the workers. It was their boss, usually seen in a suit and tie giving lectures, but today, he appeared especially fatigued, his eyes revealing an indescribable complex emotion.\n\nClearing his throat, the boss forced a stiff smile and loudly said, “Comrades, I’m very sorry to tell you that our company ultimately couldn’t withstand the market’s impact. The capital chain has broken, and we must face a harsh reality—we’ve gone bankrupt.” The last three words seemed to catch in his throat. “To reward everyone for your long-term dedication, the company has used its last funds to prepare tonight’s feast. After dinner, you can go home!”\n\n“Wait, boss, what about the wages you delayed for the last two months?” Suddenly, an older worker spoke up.\n\nThis question hit like a giant stone dropping into a calm lake, sending ripples throughout the crowd. Xiao Zhang vaguely heard the boss trying to explain, but his voice was soon drowned out by waves of shouting.\n\nSuddenly, Xiao Zhang stumbled and fell to the ground, and several workers rushed past him, charging toward the boss, who was trying to leave the scene.\n\n“Damn it, do you think you can fool me with just one meal?!”"

PRC_MAO.104.t:0 "Demanding Wages"
PRC_MAO.104.d:0 "By evening, the electronics factory had descended into chaos. The regular night shift was nonexistent, and the entire production area was restless. Some workers packed their bags, preparing to find work elsewhere, but most just wanted the “delayed” wages they were promised.\n\nXiao Zhang, along with other workers, surged toward the boss's office. Their anger had reached a boiling point. They pushed the door open forcefully and surrounded the boss, demanding the overdue wages. The boss’s face turned pale, and he tried to soothe the workers with words, but it was clearly futile.\n\n“You can’t do this! This is illegal!” The boss’s voice was weak and powerless amidst the crowd.\n\nHowever, the workers’ fury had clouded their rationality. They began shoving the boss, trying to force him to give a solution. In the chaos, several enraged workers rushed forward, punching and kicking the boss. Xiao Zhang stood by, witnessing the entire scene, filled with shock and helplessness.\n\n“You and your lackeys’ shitty rules, I’ve had enough!” A young and hot-headed worker threw a punch, and the boss’s face instantly became a bloody mess. “After torturing us, not even a penny to pay!”\n\nWith that, several workers threw the boss out of the window.\n\nMeanwhile, similar acts of revenge against foremen and team leaders were happening in other parts of the factory.\n\nXiao Zhang curled up in a corner, his face filled with helplessness and despair. Watching his colleagues leave after venting their anger, Xiao Zhang lowered his head in resignation.\n\nNow that the anger was released, what would happen next?"
PRC_MAO.104.a:0 "Who can hear my voice?"

PRC_MAO.105.t:0 "Seizing the Factory"
PRC_MAO.105.d:0 "Back in the dormitory, Xiao Zhang opened his phone with a heavy heart, and messages flooded in from the WeChat group. He scrolled through them one by one until he saw a shocking suggestion—“Seize the factory.”\n\nWhat surprised Xiao Zhang the most was that the person who proposed this idea was none other than Lawyer Feng, who had long provided free legal aid to the workers in this area, helping them with labor arbitration and lawsuits.\n\nBut Xiao Zhang knew full well that seizing the factory was an outright illegal act!\n\n“Under the current circumstances, my suggestion is that the workers can take over the factory themselves. We can organize production and I, along with my friends, will help you contact platforms and channels to sell the products, trying to pay everyone’s wages. The company’s account has been emptied, and soon, the equipment and the site will be seized by creditors. Don’t expect anything from them.”\n\n“We can’t just let it go! The boss owes us our wages, so we’ll take his factory to offset it!”\n\n“But that’s illegal. The things in the factory aren’t even ours to begin with.”\n\n“Law? What can the law give us? Our hard-earned money was taken by the boss!”\n\n“Right! We can’t just sit and wait! We need to take action!”\n\nSeeing that the workers were getting more passionate, Lawyer Feng quickly shared a link to a video on Bilibili.\n\nOut of curiosity, Xiao Zhang clicked on the link.\n\n“…[Documentary] Workers Seize the Factory, Resist Foreign Capital and Bureaucracy! (The Workers Are in Charge, Argentina 2004)…”"
PRC_MAO.105.a:0 "How can this still be done?"

PRC_MAO.106.t:0 "Preliminary Victory"
PRC_MAO.106.d:0 "The factory gate had been forcibly opened, and workers walked into the familiar workshop one by one. The air was filled with a tense and complicated atmosphere. After several days of preparation, the workers had finally taken control of the entire factory and resumed part of the production lines. Although many areas were still rudimentary, to the workers, this was already a key breakthrough in self-reliance.\n\nLi Zhan stood at a corner of the factory area, his gaze determined as he discussed the next production arrangements with several colleagues. This lean middle-aged worker had been in the factory for over a decade and was one of the technical backbones of the workshop. Over the past few days, he and Lawyer Feng, who had come to the factory, organized the workers to take over the company. Though Li Zhan didn’t have Lawyer Feng’s legal background, he had high prestige among the workers, especially in the fight for workers’ rights.\n\nSoon, the workers’ attention shifted to Li Zhan, who was standing on a makeshift platform, slowly speaking to the increasingly serious-looking workers.\n\n“Comrades, we’re not standing here today to protest, nor are we begging for anything. We are here for ourselves, to take back what belongs to us!”\n\nHe paused, glancing around, his voice growing more passionate. “Over the years, we have been crushed by the boss, the government, and even those local thugs. Every incident in the factory, every shout from the workers, we have paid the price. Remember last year, when we stood up for a small overtime pay, the boss called the police on us, accusing us of disturbing production. Did you know? At that time, the factory’s leaders and some local officials secretly colluded, trying to crush us, even forcing us to leave.”\n\n“You also know that the boss doesn’t care about our lives. We give our all on the production line every day, but every month our wages are either delayed or not paid, and there’s no decent labor protection in the factory. And while he sits in his shiny office, holding our hard-earned money, drinking and chatting with government officials and thugs, we still have to swallow our anger until he packs up everything and runs away.”\n\nSome workers murmured in low voices, while others clenched their fists in anger. Seeing this, Li Zhan continued, “But today, we are no longer the weak ones who can be easily exploited. We have taken back this factory, reclaimed the production materials that belong to us, and today we stand up to take back what we’ve lost.”\n\n“Don’t be afraid, this is a dangerous path, but we’ve come this far, there’s no turning back. We must unite, so we can gain our livelihood again, and make this factory truly belong to us, not to those arrogant capitalists.”\n\nAs he said this, his gaze swept across each worker, gradually gathering into a powerful force. “This time, we’re not going to continue being slaves. We’re going to take back control of our fate. We’re going to fight for more and better rights, to make the factory better, to produce more products, and to reclaim the sweat that was stolen from us!”\n\nThe workers’ applause thundered like a storm, and the air was filled with a mix of determination and hope. Although the road ahead was filled with uncertainty and risk, the fire in their eyes showed unwavering determination, for they knew that today’s decision could completely change their fate."

PRC_MAO.107.t:0 "Factory Night Talk"
PRC_MAO.107.d:0 "As night fell, the lights of the factory gradually dimmed, and the surrounding silence seemed to set the stage for the storm to come. Li Zhan sat in an empty office, with scattered documents and notebooks on the desk, the scent of paper lingering in the air. Outside the window, the distant sound of car horns could be heard, and the quiet factory seemed especially lonely.\n\nLawyer Feng sat across from him, his face serious, his eyes sharp. His hands were folded on the desk as if contemplating something important. Li Zhan remained silent for a moment before breaking the silence.\n\n“Xiao Feng, I heard that the creditors have sent people to negotiate,” he said quietly. “They want us to hand over the factory’s equipment and land to repay the company’s debts. If we refuse, they’ll probably turn to the government, even mobilize the police to clear us out.”\n\nLawyer Feng nodded slightly, a complex look flashing in his eyes. “Yes, the pressure from the creditors is mounting. They might tolerate a factory without a boss or management, but they’ll never let go of the profits they believe belong to them.”\n\nLi Zhan remained silent for a moment, his fist clenched tightly. “If we compromise, what’s the difference between us and our former slave lives? Even if we manage to recover a portion of the wages, but...”\n\nLawyer Feng sighed deeply. “Yes, Lao Li, reality is cruel. The factory is under your control now, but in the eyes of the law, the debts take priority. The creditors see the factory as their collateral, and the government will act under the guise of ‘social stability,’ forcibly evicting you.” He paused for a moment, as if weighing his next words carefully. “But we can’t just give up. We need to organize the workers and unite to face the impending pressure. We can use the media, the internet, and unions to fight back. If necessary, we might even consider legal action against the creditors and the factory management. When we have no other option, we won’t fear bloodshed!”\n\nAfter saying this, Lawyer Feng lowered his head, his brow furrowed. His thoughts drifted back to many years ago when he was just a student, still witnessing those events. The voices of Marxism-Leninism, the Beijing University Marxist Club, the Rhine Social Club—names that were once symbols of ideals and struggles—were now swallowed by the state machine.\n\nAfter a moment of silence, Lawyer Feng slowly said, “Behind every workers’ movement, there’s blood and sacrifice. Sometimes I wonder, can our strength not shake the mighty forces even a little? Perhaps true power is not just about organizing workers but finding the right breakthrough at the crucial moment.”\n\n“Xiao... Lawyer Feng,” Li Zhan turned slowly. “If it really comes to that day, what should we do?”"

PRC_MAO.108.t:0 "The Great Fire"
PRC_MAO.108.d:0 "The atmosphere at the Shenzhen Public Security Bureau Command was tense and oppressive. The huge display screen on the wall flickered with images from various surveillance points around the city. The director sat at the command table, furrowing his brows, while the deputy director, sweating profusely and pale-faced, whispered to his subordinates.\n\n“Director, the situation in the city center is out of control.” The deputy director's voice was low, filled with clear anxiety. “Since yesterday evening, university students have begun gathering in the city center, almost occupying all the main streets. Many are agitated, and the riot police we’ve dispatched have not only failed to maintain order but have actually escalated the situation, with several reports of injuries.”\n\nThe director stared at the screen, which displayed chaotic scenes from a street in the city center. Nearly a hundred young people were holding signs and shouting slogans, surrounding a large group of police officers. The situation seemed to be growing more intense. Some protesters were facing off against riot police, storefront windows were shattered, police cars were overturned, and the sky was lit up by flames.\n\n“That's not all, Director. Some key schools have also gone on strike,” the deputy director continued. “Some students have directly taken to the streets, joining the protests. We’ve just received reports that some areas are even seeing looting and vandalism. The situation is more complicated than we anticipated.”\n\nThe director’s hands clenched tightly on the table. The surveillance footage continued to flash, more violent clashes breaking out, and his mood grew heavier. Shenzhen, at this moment, was like a powder keg, and any spark could lead to a larger disaster.\n\n“This protest is clearly not just a random student movement. There must be deeper reasons behind it,” the director whispered. “Looking at the situation now, the protest group is no longer just students. Many citizens have joined, and judging from their words and actions, this is no longer just social dissatisfaction. It’s likely linked to the workers’ movements and factory conflicts, and may even have been organized behind the scenes.”\n\nBefore he could finish, the deputy director suddenly received an emergency report from the Pingshan District Police Bureau. A new message flashed quickly on the screen. The deputy director froze, grabbed the phone, and listened to the report in a low voice.\n\n“Director... the situation in Pingshan District is worse. We’ve just received news that several factories have been taken over by workers. The situation has completely spiraled out of control. The scale is still expanding.”\n\nThe director’s eyes widened, and his body stiffened. He took a deep breath. “What? The factories in Pingshan have been seized? That’s...”\n\n“Yes, Director, the situation has escalated. The Pingshan District Police have reported that they’re running out of manpower and have requested reinforcements from us. But...”\n\nThe deputy director’s words trailed off, his brow furrowing in frustration. “Tell them that the situation in the city center is already overwhelming us, and we simply can’t spare any more manpower. We’re stretched too thin.”\n\nThe director’s brow furrowed. He turned his gaze away from the screen and looked out the window, staring at the city in the distance, gradually fading into the mist.\n\n“Director, what should we do?” The deputy director’s voice was filled with helplessness.\n\nThe director took a deep breath and shook his head in silence."

PRC_MAO.109.t:0 "Shadows Beneath the Night"
PRC_MAO.109.d:0 "The nightfall covered the land, and the clamor and chaos of Shenzhen were sealed off behind the distant skyline. On the coastal wasteland, a small transport boat silently approached the shore, blending almost seamlessly with the night, with only a faint light flickering, silently signaling its presence.\n\nThe hatch of the boat gently opened, and twenty-eight figures silently disembarked. Their movements were swift and fluid, as though they had long been accustomed to such covert actions. The air on the boat still carried the salty scent from the long journey, and the boat emanated a chilling atmosphere.\n\nOne of the young women swiftly walked to the bow of the boat, expressionless, wearing black tactical gear suitable for movement, with knives and communication devices hanging at her waist. She was clearly the leader of the small squad. The other members followed her off the boat, dispersing across the shore, waiting in readiness.\n\nThose who were there to meet them stood at the far end of the wasteland, their eyes tense and expectant, as if awaiting the arrival of this team.\n\n“Are you the volunteers from ICOR?” the leader of the welcoming team asked softly.\n\nThe young woman nodded slightly, her voice low and full of strength, “Yes, we are here in response to the call from the Chinese people to defend the Maoist Party and the Communist Party of China, bringing you the assistance you need.” She gestured to her team to begin unloading.\n\nThe leader of the welcoming team sighed in relief, a hint of joy and urgency flashing in his eyes.\n\n“All of our members have undergone strict training, and we will leave no trace. What we’ve brought is not just food and medicine…” the young woman whispered, almost blending with the night wind, “but also light weapons—automatic rifles, grenades, a few portable rocket launchers, and general-purpose machine guns—enough to arm a platoon’s combat capability.”\n\nThe leader’s eyes flashed with surprise and joy, and he nodded in approval.\n\nOnce all the supplies were unloaded, the young woman briefly exchanged final intelligence with the welcoming personnel. After learning about the changes in Shenzhen’s situation, she nodded silently.\n\n“Let’s go, head into the dense forest.” She took the lead, leading her team into the thick forest beside them. The group quickly vanished into the darkness of the trees, as if they had never existed.\n\nOnly the empty wasteland remained, silent beneath the distant starry sky, while the transport boat slowly faded from the sea surface, quietly disappearing."

PRC_MAO.110.t:0 "The Second Wave"
PRC_MAO.110.d:0 "The streets of the city center had long been completely occupied by the furious demonstrators. The crowded streets were filled with an unusually tense atmosphere, and the escalating clashes turned the once-bustling city into a battlefield. University students, workers, citizens—almost all forms of discontent converged at this moment, gathering into an unstoppable storm.\n\nThe riot police’s tightly formed barricade had been completely breached, leaving almost no room for defense. Police cars had been overturned, windows shattered, and the officers were in disarray. In some neighborhoods, riot shields were smashed with iron bars, and could no longer withstand the angry onslaught.\n\n“This is our city!” A university student raised a red flag, standing on an overturned police car, shouting slogans passionately. Behind him, thousands of people followed his lead, shouting, “Oppose oppression, reclaim dignity!” At this moment, the demonstrators surged like a tide, breaking through every obstacle.\n\nExplosions could be heard in the distance, and the fires on the streets reflected the passion of the youth. They leaped, waving their flags, as if each shout was shaking the titan-like system. At an important intersection in the city center, the police had retreated to an alley, unable to contend with the crowd. Some riot officers began to scatter, desperately seeking cover.\n\nIn this city, which had been completely torn apart, the protesters' voices grew louder, and the red flag fluttered in the air, symbolizing their victory. The cheers of victory echoed through every corner of Shenzhen.\n\n...\n\nMeanwhile, at the electronics factory in Pingshan District, Li Zhan and Lawyer Feng were nervously and methodically leading the workers’ counterattack. The major exits of the factory were already sealed, and under Li Zhan’s leadership, the workers quickly built makeshift barricades. Barricades made of iron boxes, wooden planks, and discarded equipment towered high, and when police and unidentified thugs attempted to break through, they were met with fierce resistance.\n\n“They’re coming!” A worker shouted, pointing at the approaching police and black-clad thugs in the distance.\n\nLawyer Feng quickly stood beside Li Zhan and told the workers, “We can’t retreat! We must hold this place, hold onto what we’ve gained! We can’t let them succeed.”\n\nLi Zhan nodded, his eyes flashing with determination. “Everyone, grab your weapons, don’t panic! We must use these barricades to keep them out. If the factory falls, all our efforts will be for nothing!”\n\nAhead, the police began throwing tear gas canisters, and the gas quickly spread, but the workers didn’t retreat. Instead, they responded with even more intense firepower. Every brick thrown seemed to carry the anger and helplessness of countless workers who had been exploited in the past.\n\nAfter several hours of intense fighting, the police were finally forced to retreat. The workers had successfully held the factory. They not only preserved the physical land but also secured the lifeline they had won by seizing the factory. Standing on top of the barricades, Li Zhan looked around, a resolute smile forming on his face.\n\n...\n\nMeanwhile, at the Shenzhen Public Security Bureau Command, the director was anxiously busy. Every protest scene shown on the surveillance screens had completely spiraled out of control.\n\n“Director, the situation in the city center is beyond control. We need to prepare for the worst!” The deputy director urgently reported.\n\nThe director stared at the screen, his brow furrowed, his mood becoming even heavier. Just then, a loud sound of gunfire and explosions came from outside the command center. The deafening noise threw the entire command center into chaos.\n\n“What happened?” The director hastily grabbed the phone, but the overwhelming fear made the receiver slip from his hand.\n\nThen, footsteps could be heard approaching, getting closer. Finally, a violent crash rang out as the main entrance to the command center was forcefully broken open. The sound of the door frame collapsing sent the command center into a brief silence.\n\nSuddenly, several armed personnel with assault rifles stormed into the command center. Under the harsh lights, their faces were barely visible, masked and wearing black tactical gear. They were clearly highly trained soldiers. Following them were several demonstrators, obviously armed on the spot, holding American-made rifles and grenades.\n\n“Protect the director!” A police officer shouted in panic, but the next moment, he was knocked down by the armed personnel rushing in.\n\nEveryone froze, too stunned to react. The director had no time to issue further orders before being swiftly subdued by an armed assailant. The resistance from the command center collapsed almost instantly. The police’s guns and protective equipment were utterly useless, with no chance to respond.\n\nSoon, the raiders had successfully taken over the command center. They captured the director and raised a red flag with a chain hammer emblem high atop the Shenzhen Public Security Bureau building."
