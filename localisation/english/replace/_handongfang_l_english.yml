PRC_MAO.102.t:0 "Memorial Hall Dream"
PRC_MAO.102.d:0 "The night was heavy, and the situation in the Taiwan Strait felt like a massive stone weighing on his heart, ready to collapse at any moment. Xi Jinping, after the late-night meeting, lay on his bed, and the situation before him grew increasingly chaotic—war escalated, domestic riots erupted, and the pressure overwhelmed his thoughts. He tossed and turned, his eyes opening and closing, finally falling into a deep sleep amid anxiety.\n\nThe dream was like a cold wind, instantly transporting him to an unknown place. It was serious, yet unusually quiet, with an unspoken sense of oppressive authority in the air. He saw an elderly man standing before him, dressed in the iconic Zhongshan suit, his face stern but peaceful. It was Mao Zedong, seemingly emerging from the torrent of history, carrying an undeniable aura.\n\n“What's wrong? Young man, you don't look well,” Mao Zedong’s voice was soft, yet it seemed to carry a penetrating power that reached deep into the soul.\n\nXi Jinping froze, his heartbeat quickened, sweat dripping down his forehead. Standing before the giant in his dream, he forced himself to calm down, swallowed hard, and whispered, “The military situation is unfavorable, with imperialist threats abroad and reactionary uprisings at home. It seems everything is out of control. How should we respond?”\n\nMao Zedong smiled faintly, stroked his chin, thought for a moment, then slowly spoke, “I will tell you two paths.” He paused and looked at Xi Jinping, his gaze carrying a hint of profound meaning, “First, mobilize the masses. The people are the foundation of the revolution, and only their power is the strongest weapon.”\n\nXi Jinping’s heart tightened. It seemed he could hear the chaos growing louder in the distance, his heart pounding, but he silently nodded without speaking.\n\n“Second, unite all democratic progressives.” Mao Zedong continued, “These people may still be neutral for now, but you must understand, they are fundamentally different from the reactionaries and imperialists. Their power should not be underestimated. As long as you can unite them, the reactionaries and imperialists will surely crumble under the power of the masses.”\n\nXi Jinping’s head buzzed as if an invisible massive net was entangling him, paralyzing him. He nervously stared at Mao Zedong, feeling an inexplicable fear rising in his chest. “But…” he whispered, but before he could finish, Mao Zedong interrupted.\n\nMao Zedong’s face softened into a smile, as though nothing had happened. “The people support us, and the progressives are the same. Everyone has the spark of revolution in their hearts, ready to fight against imperialism and reactionaries.” His words were like a gentle spring breeze, soothing Xi Jinping’s nerves slightly.\n\nHowever, Mao Zedong’s gaze suddenly became sharp, and he stared intently at Xi Jinping. His tone changed: “That's right, the reactionary imperialist bourgeoisie are your people.”\n\nXi Jinping’s heart skipped a beat, as if he had been abruptly pulled from the dream, his eyes snapped open, cold sweat flowing down his hairline, his chest heaving uncontrollably. He suddenly sat up in bed, his gaze vacant, the unsettling dream still echoing in his mind."

china.339.d: "The Pacific sea breeze carried the unique warmth of California as it gently swept across the Monterey beach. In the distance, a few seagulls lazily circled in the sky, as if this beach had always been their domain.\n\nCloser, landing craft cut through the waves, emitting a deep rumble. The boat slowly approached the shore, and several soldiers from the People's Liberation Army, dressed in camouflage, jumped off, the sand flying beneath their boots. Ma Yilong stood on the beach, cigarette in his mouth, holding a map, his eyes scanning the unfamiliar land before him—just a few years ago, they had to buy tickets and sneak past the cold faces of customs officers, but now, not only could the Americans not stop them, they had personally invited them here.\n\nMa Yilong smiled slightly, a trace of undisguised pride in his eyes: “Ha, a few years ago, we had to sneak in, buy tickets, and suffer through those self-important customs officers. Now, look, they’re begging us to come. Serves them right!”\n\nA soldier quickly ran up to him, dusty and tired, coming to a halt and saluting: “Report, Commander, the advance party has reached the designated location and is ready to begin operations!”\n\nMa Yilong took a deep drag on his cigarette, then squinted his eyes and ground the burned-out cigarette butt into the fine sand. A cold smile appeared on his lips.\n\n“They always threatened us back then, but today, it’s their turn to kneel and beg. This time, we’re taking back everything they’ve taken from us!” He paused, and his voice suddenly became stern. “Remember, military discipline is like a mountain. Anyone who misbehaves will stand until dawn tonight, think about whether it's worth it!”\n\nThe soldiers replied in unison: “Yes!”\n\nMa Yilong gazed out at the distant sea, his eyes becoming even more determined. “This time, America must learn to truly respect us. We’re not here to clean them up; we want them to understand that they can’t just do whatever they want. We want them to know, we decide everything!”"

PRC_masters_of_asia_17_desc: "On this land, once interwoven with glory and brilliance, the heart of capitalism has already begun to beat with a weakening rhythm, its decaying economic system disguised as a symbol of freedom and prosperity. However, this worship of the so-called free market and the sanctity of private property has come to an end. European capitalism, in the wave of global change, is on the brink of collapse. We will no longer tolerate these systems based on oppression to continue polluting our world, thoughts, and future.\n\nOnce, Europe’s wealth and power were controlled by a few multinational corporations and financial oligarchs, turning the continent into a private playground for a small elite of capitalists. These pseudo-democratic elites seized every opportunity to maximize their interests, exploiting the working people, and revering the so-called 'free market' as the highest creed. Behind them, poverty and inequality spread across Asia, Africa, and Latin America, breeding oppression and division. Who exactly benefited from the prosperity of Western European 'civilization'? These economic systems have long rotted, unable to withstand the new wave of revolution.\n\nWe will ruthlessly destroy this fortress built by wealth and power, stripping away capitalism’s disguise and exposing its hidden violence and exploitation. The banking tycoons, factory owners, and capitalists of Western Europe will be engulfed by our revolutionary tide. The heart of capitalism will collapse under our proletarian iron fist, replaced by a new social system built on the people and rooted in fairness.\n\nWe will destroy Western Europe’s capitalist system, ensuring that those who control wealth and power can no longer extract the last drop of sweat from the working people. The true socialist ideals will be reborn on this land where they were once born, flourishing and bearing fruit."

PRC_masters_of_asia_16_desc: "The Soviet Union once shone brightly on the world stage, flying the banner of revolution, vowing to break oppression and exploitation, and establish the victory and dignity of the proletariat. However, as history progressed, the once glorious revolutionary sanctuary gradually deteriorated, with corruption and decay spreading into a red empire. Today, its remains lie before us, becoming a grave for another system and ideal.\n\nRussia, once the heart of the red empire, still takes pride in the remnants of its ruins, but these trapped legacies only serve as a betrayal of the revolutionary spirit. The bourgeois oligarchs have quickly accumulated wealth during this so-called 'transition period,' while the interests of the working class have been cast aside. The brilliance of socialism has been obscured by the games of power and bureaucratic corruption. The original ideals have become tools of governance, and the people once again face oppression and deprivation.\n\nToday, facing the corpses of these historical legacies, we must not only clear away the decayed ruins, but also completely eradicate the remaining forces. Those still serving the old system, whether they are the new generation of oligarchs or reactionaries trying to use the 'Soviet' banner for capitalist restoration, will become our targets. The corpse of the red empire will no longer be a burden; it will become the catalyst for revolution, helping us destroy the decayed forces and usher in a new socialist future.\n\nHistory will no longer tolerate those who attempt to restore capitalism. With the firmest determination, we will break all connections with the old world and bury the remains of the red empire in the dust of history. In this process, we are not only destroying the past, but also preparing for the true proletarian revolution, building a new society without rulers and the ruled."

This long-lasting revolutionary struggle not only changed Colombia’s political landscape but also injected new vitality into the socialist cause in Latin America. However, the new revolutionary government still faces significant challenges, with remnants of both internal and external counter-revolutionary forces lurking in the shadows.\n\nWe, as the vanguard of the global revolution, bear an unshirkable responsibility. Revolutionary forces from around the world have extended their helping hands to support the Colombian revolutionary government’s steady development and ensure that it remains on the right path. On this land, which has long suffered from oppression, the new revolutionary forces need strong support and guidance to consolidate their rule, stabilize public opinion, and carry out social reforms.\n\nThe victory in Colombia is a major victory for the entire Latin American revolutionary movement and sets a new example for the world revolution. In the future, as Colombia continues to advance on the socialist path, the revolutionary forces in Latin America will expand based on this victory, pushing more countries toward true proletarian liberation.\n\nRevolutionary forces from around the world will work together to help Colombia consolidate its revolutionary government, making it not only a socialist beacon in Latin America but also providing solid support and confidence for the global proletarian revolution.

china.312.d: "\n\n\n                  £GFX_MSS_event_texticon   \n\n\n\n\nDear Comrade Chairman:\n\nAs the situation in the United States further deteriorates and a full-scale civil war erupts, the global economic landscape has undergone dramatic changes. Particularly for the economy within our own country, the impact is no longer a future threat but a present reality. As the United States' largest trading partner, our economic ties with them once accounted for a significant portion of our foreign trade total. However, now, with the complete collapse of the U.S. economy, our own economy is bound to suffer direct damage in the short term. Many foreign trade enterprises are facing sharply reduced orders and a break in capital flow, which are just initial signs.\n\nOur financial system has also shown signs of instability in a short period, with the continuous devaluation of the renminbi having a profound impact on our capital markets. The withdrawal of foreign capital and the outflow of funds have plunged the confidence of our markets into a deep trough. Our previously proud 'internal circulation' strategy now appears even more fragile, and the underdeveloped domestic demand system has exposed major flaws in the face of external shocks. Without timely measures to fix these vulnerabilities, we may not be able to effectively resist potential severe fluctuations and social unrest in the domestic economy in the short term.\n\nMeanwhile, domestic consumer confidence has plummeted, and the people's concerns about the future economic outlook have led to a sudden decline in consumption demand, causing the market to shrink at an unexpectedly rapid pace. In this global economic storm, all sectors in our country, whether manufacturing, services, or high-tech industries, are undergoing dramatic adjustments, and some may even face a more severe recession.\n\nIn this situation, we may need to consider more urgent strategies to address the impending social and economic contradictions. Considering the collapse of the United States and the complete disintegration of its protection system for Taiwan, Taiwan, now without U.S. protection, may very well become a reasonable option for us at this moment. Its strategic significance may provide a way out for us in this urgent situation.\n\nBy quickly resolving the Taiwan Strait situation through force, not only can we provide short-term stability and strategic resources for our economy, but we can also take this opportunity to further integrate domestic economic resources, shift and mitigate the current economic crisis. Whether it is improving national productivity or stabilizing social order, recovering Taiwan could become a key decision in reshaping our economic structure and stimulating national power.\n\nPerhaps, through this opportunity, we will be able to bring about a more thorough self-rejuvenation for the nation and make the people feel our strength.\n\nSincerely,\nSalute"

PRC_MAO.101.t:0 "Internal Discussion Report on the Solution to the South Tibet Issue"
PRC_MAO.101.d:0 "With the complete victory of the Indian revolution, the new government led by the Indian Communist Party has officially been established in New Delhi. This government upholds an anti-imperialist and anti-feudal stance, and in its program, explicitly states respect for the sovereignty of neighboring countries and the termination of the old expansionist policies. The new government has expressed through diplomatic channels its willingness to return the South Tibet region, signaling the beginning of a new historical phase in Sino-Indian relations.\n\nThe South Tibet region, historically a part of our Tibet, was illegally ceded to India during the British colonial era through the McMahon Line. However, for a long time, the region has been a focal point of the Sino-Indian border dispute and a tool for imperialism to divide the unity of the Indian and Chinese peoples. Now, after the Indian people overthrew the old regime, the time has come to reconsider this issue.\n\nThe proposal put forward by the Indian revolutionary government to return South Tibet offers our country the possibility of reclaiming this historical territory. However, discussions within our country about the specific plan have shown some differences. Some revolutionary comrades advocate that we should fully accept the Indian side’s proposal, quickly take over the administration and military affairs of South Tibet, and resolve the dispute. By doing so, we can strengthen cooperation with the new Indian government and further advance the regional revolution. This view believes that accepting the return of South Tibet would not only restore historical justice but also lay a solid foundation for future Sino-Indian revolutionary cooperation.\n\nHowever, other comrades put forward a different opinion. They argue that we should follow the principles Mao Zedong outlined during his 1967 conversation with Indian revolutionaries. That is, after the Indian revolutionary government consolidates its power, South Tibet should be administered by India, while we negotiate the establishment of a socialist internationalist cooperation zone. They believe that handling the South Tibet issue in this way would not only avoid the immediate administrative and cultural integration problems but also more deeply reflect the spirit of mutual trust and cooperation between socialist countries. This plan emphasizes that the actual control of the region is not the goal; the true aim is to unite the people of both countries and jointly oppose imperialism and feudalism.\n\nIn this context, the internal discussion of the South Tibet issue presents a complex situation. On the one hand, accepting the return plan has clear legal and political significance and can demonstrate our consistency in handling border issues. On the other hand, advancing the idea of the cooperation zone, as outlined by Mao Zedong, reflects the flexibility and strategic foresight of revolutionary diplomacy. Both options have their merits and drawbacks, and a careful decision must be made after thorough discussion.\n\nRegardless of the final decision, one thing is certain: Sino-Indian friendly cooperation has entered a new historical phase. The resolution of the South Tibet issue is not only about territorial sovereignty but also concerns the overall layout of the Asian revolutionary process. We must consider the national interests and internationalist obligations, seeking the most suitable solution in line with the current era."

PRC_MAO.100.d:0 "The sun was bright on the playground, and the air was filled with a subtle tension and faint excitement. It was the first day of the voluntary militia training—also the first time many of them were holding real guns.\n\nThe crowd gathered at the edge of the training ground, whispering in small groups, discussing everything before them. A coach wearing camouflage walked briskly to the front of the line, a handgun strapped to his waist, his expression serious but with a hint of encouragement. He raised his hand, signaling for silence, and with a short, firm command of 'Attention!' all attention was immediately drawn to him.\n\n'Today is the first time you are engaging in gun training,' the coach’s voice was steady and deep, each word ringing clear, 'These weapons are not for show, and not to scare people. They are the revolutionary rights in your hands, the tools you will use to protect yourselves and the people.'\n\nA slight stir ran through the crowd, many people tiptoed to get a better look at the dark rifles beside the coach. A young worker with glasses murmured, 'I thought scenes like this only happened in the movies.' An older woman nearby clicked her tongue, looking nervous, 'You young folks don't know what you're dealing with. Guns are no joke!'\n\nThe coach raised his hand and divided the group into teams of ten. Each group was brought to a long table where rifles were neatly arranged. The first to approach the rifle was a young man who looked no older than twenty. His hands trembled slightly, but mostly it was an uncontrollable excitement and curiosity. The coach looked at him and softly said, 'Feel it, don’t be afraid. But remember, never point the barrel at a person, even as a joke. Check the safety, follow the steps I taught you.'\n\nThe young man took a deep breath and reached for the cold barrel, the heavy weight made him feel a sense of unreality. Following the coach’s instructions, he carefully checked the safety, his fingers brushing the stock and trigger, and a sense of pride swelled within him. The first time holding a gun felt like holding some unknown power.\n\n'Not bad, relax, don’t be too tense,' the coach nodded and moved to the next person.\n\nMeanwhile, a young girl stood nervously by the table. Her cheeks flushed from the sun, and her hands were crossed over her chest, looking unsure. 'Can... can I?' she asked hesitantly.\n\nThe coach smiled slightly and handed the rifle to her, 'Of course. You are part of the revolution, holding a gun is your right. Don’t be afraid.'\n\nShe cautiously took the gun, her palms sweating from nervousness, but once the heavy and solid feeling of the rifle settled in her hands, she felt an unexplainable sense of reassurance. She looked up, her gaze firmer than before. 'It doesn’t seem... that scary after all.'\n\nNearby, several middle-aged farmers were much more excited, and one of them grinned, 'Wow, this feels easier to handle than a hoe! Never thought I’d get to hold a gun in my lifetime!' He turned to his companion, 'Old Li, weren’t you always saying guns were rare? Now look, we’ve got them in our hands!'"

PRC_MAO.99.d:0 "Under the blazing sun, the air on the playground was somewhat restless, and the intense sunlight caused beads of sweat to form on everyone's faces. But even so, the waiting crowd seemed exceptionally focused, their eyes fixed ahead at a row of brand-new rifles. The smooth gun barrels gleamed coldly in the sunlight, like a power condensed in every breath.\n\nThe person at the front of the line was a slender young man. His palms were slightly damp, not out of nervousness, but from a vague sense of excitement. When his name was called from the list, he instinctively straightened his back and walked towards the issuing point. The arms distributor was a middle-aged man wearing sunglasses, with a stern expression that didn't easily break into a smile. He first glanced at the young man's ID, quickly confirmed his identity, and then handed him a rifle, saying coldly: “This is your rifle, serial number M-045. It's not a toy, hold it steady.”\n\nThe young man took the rifle with both hands, and his heart suddenly raced. He stared at the weapon in his hands, the dark muzzle, the precise sight, and the cold metallic feel that transmitted a sensation through his palm to his brain. This was the first time he truly owned a weapon of his own, and it felt both real and surreal. He took a deep breath, but was interrupted by the distributor's next words: “Don’t just stare at it, check if the safety is on.”\n\nThe young man quickly followed the procedure he had learned during training, awkward but cautious. The distributor observed him coldly, and the corner of his mouth seemed to curl into an almost imperceptible hint of satisfaction. “Good, remember, when the gun is not in use, the safety must always be engaged. No matter how safe or skilled you think you are, accidents only take a second. Do you understand?”\n\n“Understood!” The young man replied, his voice tinged with tension, but mostly with determination.\n\nA middle-aged worker in the back of the line was waiting for his turn. Seeing the person ahead still fiddling with the safety, he impatiently joked, “Young man, hurry up, this isn’t a movie shoot!”\n\nLaughter rippled through the crowd, but the distributor immediately turned around and gave a cold glare, his voice like nails driven into everyone's ears: “What’s so funny? Each of you has to go through this. When you hold the gun, it’s no longer a joke. Misuse it, and you’ll injure a comrade—who will bear the responsibility? Once you pick up a gun, you’re responsible for yourself and those around you. Do you understand?”\n\nThe laughter immediately ceased. Everyone straightened up, even the middle-aged worker who had been joking quickly nodded, his face becoming more serious. He muttered under his breath, “Alright, alright, no need to be so harsh. I get it.”\n\nWhen it was his turn, he was even more cautious than the young man before, almost clumsy. The distributor sighed and his tone softened slightly: “Your attitude is right, it’s better to be cautious than cause an accident. Remember, never point the gun at anyone unless you have a good reason. And don’t think that having a gun makes you invincible. Using it should be the last resort. Try to avoid using it whenever possible.”\n\nThe middle-aged worker nodded and softly asked, “What if we really need to use it?”\n\nThe distributor's gaze sharpened. “Then make sure it's truly necessary. Otherwise, don’t make trouble for yourself. Understand?”\n\n“Understood.” He nodded solemnly, holding the gun to his chest and stepping aside.\n\nAt the very end of the line was a young girl who looked barely an adult. She seemed a little nervous, unconsciously biting her nails as she waited. When it was her turn, the distributor frowned, “Don’t shake, grip it properly. The gun doesn’t care about gender or size, but it does demand that you stay calm.”\n\nShe took a deep breath, trying to steady her trembling hands. When she took the gun, she almost couldn’t believe it. The gun was heavy, and she nearly stumbled, but quickly corrected her posture. With a shaky but clear voice, she asked, “What if someone says… girls shouldn’t hold guns?”\n\nThe distributor chuckled coldly, “Then tell them this trigger only takes a few grams of force, it’s more than enough.”\n\nPeople around them laughed, but this time it wasn’t mocking—it was encouraging. The girl’s face turned bright red, but her gaze became even more determined.\n\nAfter everyone had received their guns, the distributor scanned the crowd and said in a deep voice: “Today you’ve all passed the examination and received your weapons, but this is just the beginning. The real training is just starting. Remember, the gun is a tool, not a toy. When you hold it, it means responsibility and discipline. The people’s arms belong to the people, but they must also serve the people. Understand?”\n\n“Understood!” The voices of everyone answered in unison, filled with an indescribable solemnity and excitement. In the sunlight, the row of brand-new rifles gleamed with cold light, as if symbolizing the new power of revolution."

PRC_MAO.98.d:0 "Today, the Chinese government officially announced that China has successfully built an atheistic society, becoming the second country in the world to achieve this goal after Albania during the era of Hoxha's rule. This news sparked strong reactions both domestically and internationally.\n\nAt the official press conference, the spokesperson stated that this is a key step for China towards becoming a truly socialist and modern society. He said: “Religion, as a tool of feudal and capitalist oppression, has long shackled the progress of human thought. China’s atheistic society is a new world truly freed from illusory constraints, based on science and reason.”\n\nIt is understood that the construction of atheism in China was not achieved overnight, but rather through a long period of planning and implementation. Since the large-scale demolition of religious sites, in-depth educational and ideological campaigns have been launched across the country. In schools, atheism courses have become compulsory; in factories, workers discuss how atheism intersects with labor; in villages, the elderly are encouraged to explain daily phenomena with science. During this process, numerous religious symbols and customs were completely eradicated, and religious activities were completely banned. Today, religion has completely disappeared from China’s cultural and social landscape.\n\nWhile this initiative has received broad support domestically, the international community has expressed mixed opinions. The Vatican was the first to issue a statement, accusing China of “depriving believers of their basic rights” and calling this action “a blatant violation of religious freedom.” Subsequently, European Union countries also expressed “deep concern” over China’s atheism policy. For a time, global opinion on this move by China was divided.\n\nHowever, China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs showed no sign of compromise. In response to the Vatican’s statement, the spokesperson simply said: “Nonsense.”"

They exchanged a firm glance with each other, then pushed open the wooden door of the yard. Inside, there was an angry quarrel.\n\n'You want to move out? I told you no, and that's final!' A middle-aged man stood in the living room, his voice like a drum filled with rage. He pointed at a girl standing opposite him, his eyes burning with repressed fire. 'I raised you! Without me, where would you be today? What's wrong with listening to me?!'\n\nThe girl, looking about eighteen or nineteen, leaned against the wall, her face flushed, her fists tightly clenched. 'I am not your property! You keep saying you're doing this for my good, but you don't respect my thoughts at all! I just want to work in the city. Why can't I do that?!'\n\nThe moment the patrol members entered, the entire room fell silent for a second. The middle-aged man glanced at their armbands, and his face immediately darkened. 'What are you here for? Family matters, understand? This is my family, and outsiders have no right to interfere!'\n\n'Family matters?' The lead patrol member sneered, his tone as sharp as a knife. 'You call this family matters? Do you know what your actions are? Oppression! Control! Deprivation of freedom! This is the 21st century, not the era when your father’s generation could casually slam the table and scold people.'\n\n'What are you people?!' The man’s face turned crimson, his anger rising. 'I discipline my own daughter, I don’t need you to tell me how to do it! She’s my daughter, and I have the right to control her!'\n\nThe girl’s gaze darkened, and she shrank into the corner of the room, like a bird too oppressed to fight back.\n\n'Right? Who gave you that right?' The patrol member’s voice suddenly dropped, with a dangerous chill in his eyes. He raised his hand, pointing at the girl, his words slow and deliberate, 'She is an independent individual, not your private property. How dare you strip her of her freedom? How dare you suppress her will in the name of "father"?'\n\nThe man froze for a moment, then his rage flared even more. 'Stop spouting this nonsense! You people don’t understand what family is! You are destroying families, do you understand?!'\n\n'Family?' Another patrol member sneered, 'Is this your family? A cage? A prison? We’re here to rescue her from this prison!'\n\n'Don't you dare try!' The man yelled, taking a step toward the girl, reaching out to grab her arm.\n\n'Stop right there.' The lead patrol member coldly uttered two words, then swiftly drew a handgun from his waist, steadying the barrel at the man's feet. 'Take another step, and try it.'\n\nThe man froze, staring in disbelief at the patrol member. 'You really dare to shoot?!'\n\n'We won’t shoot innocent people, but you are not innocent.' The patrol member’s voice was as cold as ice. 'We are here to rescue her, not to listen to you ranting.'\n\nThe girl’s eyes suddenly brightened. She clenched her teeth and finally stood up straight from the wall. 'I want to leave, I don’t want to stay here anymore!'\n\nThe man’s face turned pale with fury, his finger trembling as he pointed at her, as if he were about to cramp. 'You dare leave! If you leave, don’t ever come back! You’re unfilial! You—'\n\n'Shut up!' The girl suddenly exploded, her voice sharp and decisive. 'I am not your tool! You raised me not to be your puppet! If I leave, I will never come back!'\n\nThe man stood frozen, as though struck by a heavy blow to the head. He stared wide-eyed as the girl walked out from under the protection of the patrol members, his lips moved, but no words came out.\n\nSimilar scenes were unfolding in villages, cities, and millions of households. Young people broke free from the shackles of their families, beginning to shout for their freedom. And the parents—some were angry, some shocked, some even in tears—but none of it could stop the tide of revolution.\n\nIn one village, an old mother knelt on the ground, crying uncontrollably, clutching a patrol member's pants leg, pleading, 'Please, give my son back to me! He can’t leave, he’s still young, he doesn’t understand!'\n\nThe patrol member glanced down at her, his voice as steady as ever. 'He’s not young anymore, he has the right to choose his own life. Kneeling will only make him want to leave more.'\n\nIn another town, a young man, just freed from the protection of the patrol team, turned back and yelled at his cursing father, 'Dad, you don’t love me! You just want to control me! I’m free now, if you still want to curse, go ahead, I won’t listen anymore!'\n\nAcross the country, young people were breaking through the shackles of family with unstoppable momentum, and the foundation of patriarchy was shaking at this very moment."

PRC_MAO.96.t:0 "Judging the War Criminals"
PRC_MAO.96.d:0 "The square was packed with people, and there was an indescribable sense of tension and excitement in the air. It was a day destined to be remembered by history, the trial of high-ranking PLA generals was about to begin. On the high platform for the trial, red flags fluttered in the wind, with a massive slogan behind them: 'Those who betray the people must pay the price!' On both sides were armed militia forming a security line, holding rifles with vigilant eyes. The crowd surrounded the trial platform, standing densely, some with faces filled with anger, others with curiosity, but regardless, everyone understood that this was a reckoning of justice and betrayal.\n\nZhang Youxia was slowly escorted onto the stage, his face weary and haggard, but his eyes were still defiant. Behind him were dozens of high-ranking PLA generals, most of whom were looking down, their faces pale like death, though a few had eyes full of hatred, clearly not yet accepting the facts before them.\n\nThe trial began, and the chatter of the crowd instantly quieted, as if the whole world held its breath.\n\n'Zhang Youxia!' The judge’s voice boomed, full of undeniable power. 'Do you know the crimes you have committed?'\n\nZhang lifted his head, sneered, and asked in return, 'I’ve served the country for years, what crime have I committed? Without generals like me, this army would have collapsed long ago! You mobs don’t even know what order is!'\n\nThe crowd erupted in anger, shouting, 'Kill him!' 'The executioner must die!' The militia fired two shots to silence the commotion.\n\nThe judge sneered, slamming a stack of documents onto the table. 'During the Taiwan Strait war, the massacre of innocent civilians—wasn’t that your order? You say you’ve protected the country’s order, but have you really protected the people’s interests?!'\n\nZhang Youxia fell silent for a moment, then suddenly shouted, 'That was the country’s need! If we didn’t suppress them, the whole country would be in chaos! Without us, the country wouldn’t even exist anymore!'\n\nThe judge countered without hesitation: 'Country? The so-called country you protected was built on the blood and flesh of innocent people? Is it built on the betrayal of the proletarian revolutionary ideals? You used the name of 'discipline' to commit evil, but forgot that the people are the true masters of the country! A country like this, we don’t need it!'\n\nThe crowd erupted into thunderous applause and cheers. Zhang Youxia’s face changed, and he looked down at the excited faces below, as if realizing that no matter how much he defended himself, the outcome could not be changed.\n\nNext came the trial of other generals. A general who had participated in the 1989 suppression tried to defend himself, saying, 'That was an order from above, I was just following orders!'\n\nBut the judge coldly replied, 'An order from above? Does the blood of the people also carry the color of an order from above? When facing innocent civilians, did you hesitate? Or did you only see the order and forget humanity?'\n\nThe general collapsed to the ground, speechless.\n\nSoon, the verdict was announced. The vast majority of the generals were sentenced to life labor reform, to be sent to construction sites to atone for their sins with a lifetime of labor. As for Zhang Youxia and other key figures, they were sentenced to death by the people’s court. Their crimes were so severe that no means of atonement could erase them.\n\nAt the moment of the death sentence, the crowd erupted into deafening cheers, shouting, 'Justice has finally come!' 'The executioner must pay the price!'\n\nHowever, the trial did not go smoothly. After the trial, rumors spread that some generals were secretly contacting stationed troops, attempting to organize armed resistance. The atmosphere suddenly grew tense, and the militia immediately went on full alert.\n\nAt a military base in the southeast, the tense standoff lasted for a whole day. Some PLA soldiers, incited by the generals, tried to pick up weapons, but when they saw the militia closing in from all directions, they were stunned. The militia outnumbered them by more than ten to one, and their equipment was just as good. More importantly, among those soldiers who had originally followed the generals, many began to reflect and slowly put down their weapons.\n\nA young PLA soldier looked at his rifle, shook his head, and quietly said to his companion, 'Who are we fighting for? For these beasts, or for our own families?'\n\nIn the end, the so-called resistance collapsed in a chaotic mess. The generals tried to escape, but were easily captured by the militia. By the final stage of the trial, no one dared to resist.\n\nWhen the final gavel fell, the entire square fell into brief silence. Then, a militia representative stood up and announced loudly, 'From today on, the people’s army will be given real meaning. The gun will no longer be a tool of oppression, but the sword of the people!'\n\nThe crowd surged with excitement, cheers rising like waves, and a bloody and tearful reckoning finally came to an end."

PRC_MAO.95.t:0 "The Statue Falls"
PRC_MAO.95.d:0 "In the city square, a huge statue of Confucius stood, as though looking down on the people. However, at this moment, the area around the statue was filled with people. The patrol team members were holding sledgehammers and crowbars, the tools shining with a metallic gleam. The leader of the group turned to look at the crowd, and loudly said, 'Look, this is the so-called "model for all ages"! The one who was worshipped like a god, Confucius. But what did he teach us? The three principles and five constants, loyalty to the king, love for the country, living on our knees! Today, we’re going to knock him off his pedestal! Tear it down!'\n\nAt the command, the patrol team members didn’t hesitate, swinging their sledgehammers hard at the base of the statue. The sound of breaking stones echoed across the square, startling some elderly onlookers. A white-bearded old man stepped forward, trembling as he pointed at the patrol team and shouted, 'How can you young people do this! Confucius taught us the principles of being human, don’t you dare smash him! Aren’t you afraid of retribution?'\n\nThe patrol member paused, sneering as he turned around. 'Retribution? Confucius taught you to kneel for so long, didn’t he? Today, we’re going to tell you, no one deserves to make us kneel!' He swung his hammer again, and the right foot of the statue broke off with a crash, sending a huge stone tumbling to the ground, creating a cloud of dust. The old man’s face turned pale with anger, and he was about to rush forward, but was stopped by a young person beside him.\n\n'Old man, stop it,' the young man shook his head, a cigarette dangling from his mouth, full of disdain. 'You’ve knelt enough in your life, no one’s forcing you to get up. But us, we don’t kneel!'\n\nElsewhere, deep in the mountains, in a thousand-year-old temple, a towering Buddha statue was being worshipped. The temple's abbot knelt before the statue, his face filled with terror as he looked at the patrol team outside the door. 'Amitabha, donors, the Buddha is the embodiment of compassion, why must you destroy this sacred place?'\n\nThe leader of the patrol team lazily dug at his ear, impatiently replying, 'Compassion? If the Buddha is compassionate, then why are those poor people still suffering? If gods worked, would there still be war and hunger in this world? Stop talking, bring the explosives!'\n\nSeveral people quickly tied bundles of explosives to the statue’s base. One young man, mocking the abbot, turned to light the fuse, saying, 'Abbot, if you truly believe in the Buddha, let’s see if he shows up to protect you. Otherwise, let’s see just how compassionate he really is!'\n\n'Please, don’t!' the abbot shouted with all his strength, but before his words could finish, the fuse was lit. A few seconds later, a massive explosion shook the entire temple, smoke and dust billowing everywhere. The top half of the Buddha statue shattered, crashing to the ground, its head rolling several times before finally stopping at the entrance. Some devotees knelt on the ground, crying in pain, but the patrol members laughed wildly.\n\n'What, is the god not protecting you?' A girl raised an eyebrow and sneered. 'Wake up, the statue in the temple is just a rock, what’s there to cry about?'\n\nAnd in a small church in the south, a dozen or so believers were gathered around the statue of Jesus, praying for a miracle. A young priest raised the Bible with trembling hands, his voice hoarse as he read, 'Lord, please forgive their ignorance... they don’t know what they are doing...'\n\n'Oh, we know exactly what we’re doing,' a patrol member sneered as he kicked open the church door, full of disdain. 'We’re here to tell your lord that he’s lost his market in China.'\n\nThe faces of the believers were filled with anger and fear, but no one dared step forward to stop them. The patrol member raised his gun, aiming at the statue of Jesus. 'Come on, let’s see if your lord dares to stand up and save you.'\n\n'Please, don’t do this, please...' An old lady pleaded, but the next second, a gunshot rang out, and the head of the statue shattered, pieces flying everywhere. A loud scream filled the church as several believers collapsed to their knees, crying inconsolably.\n\n'Tch, fragile.' The patrol member who had fired the shot blew on the barrel and coldly threw out, 'Looks like your lord isn’t so useful after all.' He turned to the others. 'Tear it down, what are we keeping it for?'\n\nThe cross was soon pried down, and the walls of the church were knocked down. The believers were forced to retreat to the street, some silently crying, others cursing quietly, but none dared to resist.\n\nThis day, countless statues of gods fell from their high altars, and countless temples and churches were reduced to rubble. The patrol members showed no hesitation, for they knew that this was not just a material destruction, but a spiritual revolution. They raised their hammers, explosives, and guns, completely shattering the sanctity and authority of the past.\n\n'God is nothing but a piece of stone. We smashed the stone, and only then did humanity truly rise.' A patrol member stood amidst the ruins, his voice cold."

PRC_MAO.94.d:0 "Across the country, a storm seems to be sweeping through. The sounds of temple bells, mosque prayers, and church hymns have all turned into jarring noise, the fate of being completely destroyed is irreversible. The patrol team members, wearing sunglasses, drive bulldozers and excavators, some carrying boxes of explosives, steadily pushing into the heart of every religious symbol. Their steps are firm and cold, their faces marked with undisguised excitement and mockery.\n\nIn a southeastern city, in front of a church, dozens of believers form a circle, anxiously blocking the church door. Most of them are middle-aged or elderly, their eyes filled with pleading and resentment. An old woman with graying hair kneels on the ground, crying and clasping her hands together, 'Please, this is our faith, this is our home! Don't tear it down, please don't tear it down!'\n\nA patrol member standing next to a bulldozer clicks his tongue, takes off his sunglasses, and coldly looks at the old woman. 'Faith? Home? Don’t make me laugh, can this thing feed you? Where did the money from the church go? How much did you donate, and tell us, what has God given you in return?'\n\nThe old woman trembles and doesn’t answer, but a middle-aged man standing beside her can’t help but step forward and urgently says, 'God is the support of our souls! You can’t do this! If you tear this place down, we will lose our hearts!'\n\nThe patrol member shrugs nonchalantly, 'If it’s gone, then it’s gone. If your heart relies on this broken thing, then it’s really cheap.' He turns back and waves at the excavator driver, 'Stop talking to them, let’s get started.'\n\nWith a loud roar of machinery, the outer wall of the church collapses. The believers let out a collective scream, some collapse to the ground, some cover their faces and weep, but no one dares to rush forward to stop it.\n\nOn the other side, in a northwest village, a mosque’s spire stands tall, but it is surrounded by patrol team vehicles. The elderly Muslim men, their eyes bloodshot, are continuously cursing, 'You bastards! Heavenly retribution will come! You will burn in hell!'\n\nA patrol member lazily leans against a jeep, biting into a large meat skewer. He chews slowly, deliberately making clear chewing sounds, then lifts the greasy skewer and taunts an elderly man with glaring eyes, 'See this? This is the kind of food "God" didn’t let you eat, it’s really delicious!'\n\nThe old man trembles with anger, picks up a stone from the ground, and is about to throw it. Another young patrol member immediately raises his gun and fires a shot into the sky, 'Try it? We didn’t come here to reason with you.' The gunshot comes down like a cold splash of water, freezing everyone in place.\n\n'You traitors! God will punish you!' An old man screams hoarsely, his face flushed with anger.\n\n'Traitors?' A young patrol member, obviously from a Muslim background, sneers and steps forward. He takes a big bite of the meat skewer, his mouth full of oil, and says, 'You call me a traitor? Heh, I think you’re the ones, always praying to that nonexistent God, and God lets you stay poor and kneel every day? I don’t buy into that!' As he speaks, he casually yanks off his traditional headscarf and throws it on the ground, stomping on it, 'This damn thing should have been thrown away a long time ago!'\n\nSeveral elderly men, enraged, try to rush forward, but they are stopped by the patrol members. A tall patrol member puts his hand on one of the old man’s shoulders, his voice low but full of intimidation, 'Stop it. Keep causing trouble, and we’ll take you away.'\n\n'You beasts!' The old man glares and yells, but in the end, he sits back down weakly, covering his face and saying nothing.\n\nThe excavator roars into the mosque courtyard. After several loud crashes, the spire sways and then collapses into a pile of rubble. The elderly men wail and kneel, clutching their chests, murmuring prayers as if seeking divine protection. But the young patrol members do not stop; instead, they laugh even louder.\n\n'Where’s your God? Why doesn’t he come down to save your mosque?' A young woman giggles, her tone full of mockery.\n\nOn this day, religious sites all over the country are being destroyed in the loud roar of destruction. Angry curses and cries fill the air, but what dominates more is the leisurely and bitter mockery of the patrol members. They hesitate not at all because they know that they are carrying out the mission history has entrusted to them: completely burying religion and freeing the shackles of thought.\n\nIn the distance, on a pile of rubble, a patrol member pats his companion on the shoulder, 'Done, let’s go, next stop.' His voice carries no trace of sentiment.\n\nOn this day, the hammer of atheism rings louder than ever."

The patrol team members stand straight, wearing sunglasses and stern expressions. Their clothing varies—some in tactical gear, some in plain work clothes, and even a few in anime T-shirts—seemingly out of place with the serious scene, but their presence is overwhelmingly powerful.\n\nThe villagers gather in groups around the square, murmuring in discussion. Some show resistance, others express curiosity. An elderly man with a cane stands at the front of the crowd, his expression defiant. His cane taps the ground with a rhythmic thud. Behind him, several other elderly men whisper quietly, their eyes watchful.\n\n'Everyone quiet down, today we’ll keep it simple—superstition harms people!' A patrol member steps forward, his voice booming. He holds a microphone, directly launching into his speech, 'What gods and Buddhas? It’s all nonsense! You’ve believed in gods for half your life, but has any god truly helped you? When you’re sick, do you avoid the hospital and pray instead? Do you think a worthless talisman is more reliable than technology in curing illness?'\n\nAt his words, the crowd immediately murmurs. An old woman can’t help but speak out, 'We worship gods because it’s our tradition! Passed down by our ancestors, how can you just call it nonsense? If you don’t understand, stop talking!' \n\nThe patrol member sneers and turns to look at her, 'Tradition? If you fall ill, do you think the gods will cure you? Last year, your grandson had a fever of 39 degrees, and you took him to the temple to burn incense, but his condition worsened, and you still had to send him to the hospital, right?'\n\nThe old woman’s face turns red and her voice falters, unable to respond.\n\nAt that moment, a young man leaps out from the crowd, his face full of anger. 'Exactly! My mother is like that too. Before, my dad had back issues, and they wouldn’t go to the hospital, but kept going to the temple to kneel before the Buddha. In the end, he was hospitalized! Isn’t that asking for trouble? Now, the village is all automated and living is so good, but everyone spends their time worshipping gods, and there are more people in the temple than in the square!'\n\nHis words ignite more young people’s emotions, and many begin to clap, some shouting, 'We support this! Down with parental tyranny!'\n\nHowever, before the applause can last for long, the old man’s face turns livid with rage, and he swings his cane, shouting at the stage, 'Tear down the family? What are you trying to do? Without family, will society even exist anymore?!'\n\nAnother young man standing on the stage immediately responds, his tone calm but unwavering, 'Yes, that’s right! The family must be dismantled! Marx and Engels clearly pointed out in the 'Communist Manifesto' that the modern family is nothing but a breeding ground for bourgeois exploitation and a stronghold of patriarchy. To truly achieve equality and freedom, the old family must be broken, and in its place, a new social unit based on cooperation and equality must emerge.'\n\nThese words strike the elderly men like a heavy blow. The old man’s face turns pale, and he weakens at the knees, collapsing to the ground. Some nearby elders scramble to help him up, while others angrily shout, 'Look what you’ve done to him! You’ve made him faint!'\n\nHowever, the young people on stage show no sign of retreating. They turn to the crowd and continue, 'Don’t call us radicals. We’re not just criticizing; we’re rebuilding. The new family will not be maintained by authority but by equality and cooperation. We want everyone to grow freely, not live under the shadow of their parents!'\n\nThe applause grows louder, and some even raise their fists, shouting, 'We don’t want to be puppets of our parents! Long live the revolution!' Some young people, long oppressed by their parents, even jump up in excitement, as if they’ve found an escape from their repressive lives.\n\nBut the elderly men start cursing angrily, and a few even rush toward the stage, trying to interrupt the speech. Other patrol members immediately step forward to stop them and persuade them to go back. Some mutter quietly, 'These old guys, they’re really stubborn.'\n\nThe atmosphere at the scene nearly gets out of control, but as the youth on stage speaks again, the crowd gradually quiets down. He finally says, 'The Cultural Revolution is not to attack anyone, but to make everyone freer! Feudal families have oppressed us for thousands of years, and now it’s time for liberation. You can be angry today, but history will ultimately be on our side!'\n\nWith his final words, a patrol member quietly says:"

PRC_MAO.91.d:0 "As night falls, the screens on street corners begin playing the latest news broadcast. As usual, the host’s voice is low and steady, but today’s content carries a sharpness that cuts through the fog of history.\n\n'When we look back at the history of the People's Republic, many might think it was a chapter of great victory, a 'socialist utopia' built by the Chinese people through countless difficulties. But today, we must calmly face the truth—at the time of the founding of the People’s Republic, it was already a false bubble, a shiny but nutrient-less 'margarine.'\n\nThe scene switches to black-and-white footage from the Anti-Japanese War, showing numerous peasants kneeling in the fields, a landlord holding up a ledger. 'In the 1930s and 40s, while we shouted "Resist Japan and Save the Nation," the flames of revolution quietly went out. The once-ardent 'struggle against landlords and land distribution' turned into a ridiculous 'rent and interest reduction.' The old landlord class was preserved, and the suffering of the peasants was only slightly alleviated. The sharp edge of revolution was ruthlessly dulled, and the essence of the struggle was covered up by compromise.' The off-screen voice is cold and sharp, like a knife cutting through the audience’s ears.\n\nThe camera shifts, showing a simple ferry crossing with several workers in tattered clothes sitting on the ground, holding opium pipes. 'In Yan’an, a drug called "special product" was found throughout the villages. Yes, that’s opium. To maintain the economy and buy military supplies, even in the ferry battles, this drug was considered hard currency and widely cultivated. Revolution? Liberation? Perhaps just slogans; behind the helpless reality was a deep betrayal of proletarian beliefs.'\n\nThe host’s gaze becomes more stern, but his tone carries a subtle sarcasm. 'Was the victory in the Liberation War the result of the revolutionaries’ efforts? Or was it the 'submission' of the Kuomintang reactionaries? Long Yun, the slave owner of Yunnan, still sat high in power; Li Zongren, the executioner of the 'April 12th' purge, actually became a target for united front efforts. All of this tells us that, before it was even born, the People’s Republic had already destroyed its own revolutionary nature. The so-called united front didn’t bring about proletarian liberation, but a reshuffling of the old power structures.'\n\nThe scene continues with photos from early Central People’s Government meetings. 'At the founding of the nation, we repeatedly said we were the 'vanguard of the proletariat,' but who made up this vanguard? A large number of 'patriotic left-wing nationalist intellectuals' became the backbone of the party. Many of them were not Marxists but nationalists. Their focus wasn’t on the global proletariat but narrowly fixed on the national borders. What they cared about wasn’t the fate of workers, but making the country one of the powerful nations among imperialist powers. Thus, the workers’ revolution was replaced by the political fantasies of nationalists.'\n\nThe camera returns to the host, whose voice grows deeper, but is as thunderous as ever, 'We must face this fact. From 1949 onward, this land has never truly had socialism. This is a revisionist state, a capitalist version disguised as revolution. The fate of the working class has never changed; they continue to be exploited, only by a different exploiter. The freedom of the proletariat was never realized; they are still suppressed, but this time under the banner of "socialism."'\n\nThe television screen slowly fades to black, replaced by a brand-new scene of a raised iron hammer smashing a giant city wall. 'As we look back on this history, it is not to dwell on failure, but to learn from it. The past of the People’s Republic is a high wall built on lies, and we must use the revolutionary iron hammer to shatter it completely. Revisionism was never a bridge, but a stumbling block; it was never a progressive force, but a reactionary obstruction.'\n\nThe host’s final words are strong and resolute, 'Revolution cannot compromise, history cannot deceive. The new revolution must begin with the complete negation of revisionism. Let us use action to tell the future, real socialism will never be altered again!' The screen fades to total darkness."

This nationwide program, led by the New People's Republic of China, focuses on a name that everyone is both familiar and unfamiliar with: Mao Zedong.\n\n'Mao Zedong was a tyrant,' the news anchor’s voice is low and firm, as if every word is a stone sinking deep into the hearts of the listeners. 'But he was not a tyrant in the traditional sense. He did not openly seize the fruits of the people's labor like a dictator; rather, he used the mask of revolution to conceal his essentially counter-revolutionary nature. Today, we will deconstruct this historically deified figure from the perspective of the revolutionary left and reveal his true face.'\n\nThe scene shifts, and the television screen shows a large text: 'Portrait of the 'Cultural Revolution Conservatives.'' Then, old photos begin to appear, with a voice-over slowly narrating.\n\n'First, we must ask: How did Mao Zedong go from a revolutionary leader to the gravedigger of revolution? The answer lies in each of his decisions, especially the moment he betrayed the Shanghai Commune. In 1967, a group of true revolutionaries tried to establish a prototype of proletarian democracy—the Shanghai Commune. The establishment of the Commune was a complete negation of the old state machinery and a direct practice of proletarian autonomy. However, Mao Zedong personally halted it and instead promoted his so-called 'Great Unity.' This 'Great Unity,' on the surface, was about integrating forces, but in reality, it was a compromise with the old bureaucracy, opening the path for the Cultural Revolution conservatives.'\n\nThe scene shifts to archival footage documenting the release of the 'Military Committee Eight Articles.' 'And this was only the beginning. In the 'Military Committee Eight Articles' and 'Military Committee Ten Articles' of 1967, Mao Zedong further consolidated the military's control over local affairs. The military control committees ran rampant, suppressing the rebels and erasing countless true revolutionaries on the frontlines of their struggle. He turned a blind eye to all of this, even encouraging it. Wei Guoqing’s atrocities in Guangxi reached unimaginable levels, with horrifying incidents of cannibalism. Mao Zedong remained silent; his silence was complicit in the reactionary violence.'\n\nThe camera returns to the anchor, who holds a thick file in his hand, his tone increasingly serious. 'The investigation into the 'May 16 Movement' was initially defined as a struggle against counter-revolutionary elements. However, this movement eventually turned into a comprehensive suppression of divergent ideologies. Countless revolutionaries with different viewpoints were labeled as 'May 16 elements,' brutally persecuted, and Mao Zedong not only failed to stop this, but became the driving force behind the purge. He persecuted the heretical factions, stifled true ideological revolution, and trampled on the proletariat’s hope for democracy.'\n\nThe television screen shifts again, showing historical footage from the Sino-Soviet border. 'Mao Zedong not only betrayed the revolutionary forces at home, but he also used nationalistic sentiment to cover up domestic contradictions. The so-called 'Three Worlds' theory was nothing more than his excuse to divide international revolutionary forces. He tied China’s economy to international capitalism and attempted to use 'great power diplomacy' to cover up the struggles of the domestic proletariat. This strategy, while seemingly expanding China’s influence internationally, in fact isolated the international proletarian struggle.'\n\nThe screen freezes on the aftermath of the 'September 13 Incident' of 1971, with a video of Mao Zedong speaking at a conference. 'He repeatedly emphasized unity, the 'victorious conference,' attempting to reconcile the various forces in the February Countercurrent. Behind this reconciliation was his compromise to stabilize his power. What was the result? The wave of revolution was suppressed, the mass line was stifled, and the struggles at the grassroots level dissipated like bubbles.'\n\nAt this point, a young and passionate voice is heard from the television, the camera switching to a young scholar from a revolutionary theory institute, giving a speech. 'We criticize Mao Zedong today, not to smear the revolution itself, but to restore the truth of history! He did not complete the liberation of the proletariat; instead, at crucial moments, he stopped or even reversed progress. He betrayed the principles of the 'Sixteen Articles' and sacrificed the blood of countless rebels just to secure a temporary 'stability.' This is not only a desecration of the revolution, but also a betrayal of future struggles!'\n\nThe television screen finally freezes on a comparison image: one side shows a photo of Mao Zedong standing on Tiananmen, while the other side shows the memorial portrait of the rebels who were suppressed by the military. The host's voice rings out like a resounding bell, 'Today, we no longer revere the 'Old Mao,' but seek to break his myth and restore the true history. We must tell everyone that revolution is for the liberation of the people, not for the power games of a few. The new revolution will not repeat the mistakes of the past. The people of the new era will take control of their own destiny!'"

PRC_MAO.89.t:0 "Right Path Is Not the Way"
PRC_MAO.89.d:0 "Late at night, the Zhengdao Farm is shrouded in quiet, with only the occasional sound of a dog barking in the distance breaking the silence. The appearance of this farm is no different from a typical farm: low buildings, a vegetable garden behind a fence, and several old tractors making creaking sounds, parked in the corner. It seems like an ordinary rural place. However, today's special action team understands that this place hides something much darker than its outward appearance.\n\n'Captain, the outer perimeter is set up, we can move out,' a team member’s deep voice comes through the earpiece.\n\n'Proceed.' Captain Li Qingyan’s voice is calm but carries an undeniable firmness. He raises his hand, leading the special operations team through the dark, silently approaching the farm’s gate.\n\nZhengdao Farm has been quite prominent since the revolution. Han Deqiang, a so-called 'old leftist' who used the revolution to overthrow the government, secretly rebuilt the farm during the tumultuous transition period and packaged it as a 'socialist new life practice base.' However, the intelligence gathered by the Revolutionary Committee shows that this place is actually a brainwashing camp disguised as 'ideals,' specifically designed to lure young people who have not yet fully understood the revolution. Even more frightening, the internal operating model of the farm is eerily similar to the past practices of the Falun Gong cult: thought control, hierarchical oppression, and extreme behavior, with a large number of young people deeply trapped within.\n\n'Action is divided into three groups: rescue hostages, search for documents, and capture the key targets. Remember—safety first.' Captain Li Qingyan repeats the orders.\n\nThe team members nod, quickly dispersing into action.\n\nIn the farm’s hall, the lights are dim, and a group of young people in their twenties sit together, listening to a middle-aged man on stage, shouting hoarsely, 'Only Teacher Han can lead us down the true socialist road! You must abandon those hypocritical slogans and follow the guidance of our Zhengdao! The previous revolution has been stolen, and we must take back the power that belongs to us!'\n\nThe young people below nod incessantly, and some even shout 'Long live Zhengdao!'\n\n'What a bunch of brainwashed kids,' mutters team member Chen Yang, hidden in the shadows, frowning. His hand tightens around the grip of his gun.\n\n'Prepare for action.' Li Qingyan gives a low command through the earpiece.\n\nIn the next second, the farm’s gate is kicked open, and special forces members, fully armed, rush into the hall. Smoke grenades quickly fill the space, and with the sharp sounds of shouting and hurried footsteps, the entire hall is thrown into chaos.\n\n'Don’t move! Put your heads down! Everyone!' a special forces member shouts loudly, suppressing the chaos in the room.\n\nThe middle-aged man on stage, Han Deqiang’s close associate, Tian Wenyuan, immediately turns pale upon seeing the special forces members rushing in and tries to run towards the back door. However, as soon as he takes a step, he is tackled to the ground by a precise grab and quickly handcuffed.\n\n'What gives you the right to arrest me! We’re lawful! We are Zhengdao!' Tian Wenyuan yells in madness, but no one pays attention.\n\nOn the other side, the special forces team quickly rescues the controlled young people. Some look confused and uncertain about what is happening, but many others, upon hearing the shout 'We’ve come to rescue you,' begin to change their expressions.\n\n'You’ve been deceived! They’ve used your ideals as weapons, but in reality, they are enslaving you!' Li Qingyan stands in the middle of the hall, speaking loudly. He points at Tian Wenyuan, his voice full of anger, 'The 'Zhengdao' you believe in is just a cover for them. They control your thoughts and take away your freedom with 'ideals!'\n\nA young man shakes with fear and stands up, asking in a low voice, 'But... aren’t we practicing socialism? Isn’t it for equality?'\n\nLi Qingyan looks at him, his gaze firm, 'True socialism is about making people their own masters, not being controlled by a few. Look at yourselves! Han Deqiang and his subordinates make you work hard here, giving them your thoughts, while they sit in high positions and use you to gain power. Do you really think that’s equality?'\n\nThe hall goes quiet for a few seconds, followed by the sound of some people sobbing. Clearly, some have started to realize the truth.\n\nA few hours later, all the hostages at the farm are rescued, and Tian Wenyuan and other core figures are taken into custody. The operation team uncovers a large number of illegal documents in the farm’s basement, including brainwashing materials, surveillance records, and even plans for punishing 'traitors.' These documents will become the key evidence in classifying Han Deqiang’s organization as a 'cult.'\n\nIn later reports, Zhengdao Farm is explicitly defined as 'a cult organization of the same level as Falun Gong,' with its essence being an illegal group that uses 'socialist ideals' as a cover for thought control and exploitation. The report states: 'The existence of Zhengdao Farm is not only a betrayal of the proletarian revolution but also a desecration of the people's ideals. Han Deqiang and his comrades, under the banner of revolution, are performing reactionary acts and must be thoroughly held accountable.'\n\nThe success of this operation significantly weakened the residual influence of the 'old left' in society. Han Deqiang’s supporters began to scatter, with many choosing to leave his organization. The young people who had been deceived were sent to re-education centers and gradually returned to normal life."

PRC_MAO.88.t:0 "The Painted Skin"
PRC_MAO.88.d:0 "In the dimly lit conference room, the light from the projector flickers on the wall, showing old black-and-white photographs and yellowing files. This is a special denunciation meeting, focusing on several names that once held great power in Chinese politics: Zhou Enlai, Chen Yun, and their conservative allies. In the photos on the wall, Zhou Enlai's face, always smiling, still seems warm and approachable. However, everyone present knows that this is just a painted skin, a disguise that covers the harsh reality.\n\n'Comrades, we need to deeply understand that what these people left us is not the monument of the 'perfect person' but a giant stone pressing down on the people!' Investigator Li Hao, who is presiding over the meeting, speaks with a powerful voice. He stands at the podium, using his laser pointer to point at Zhou Enlai's name on the screen, his anger clearly visible.\n\n'Zhou Enlai, the 'great premier', ha! Truly great! He played the ultimate game of compromise and opportunism within the party. He was a traitor to the workers' and peasants' revolution, an advocate of class reconciliation, and a disruptor of the proletarian struggle!' Li Hao pauses and looks over the audience, 'From the secret files left behind after his death, we see not a selfless 'revolutionary', but a 'conservative' leader who was good at glossing over the facts and suppressing progress. Under the banner of 'stability', he actually served the bourgeoisie and paved the way for revisionism! He 'cared about workers and peasants', but what he cared about was keeping the workers quiet and obedient, and making sure the peasants stayed docile. He 'loved intellectuals', but used them as tools against class struggle!'\n\nLow murmurs rise from the audience, as many hear for the first time the contents of these files, causing them to question the previously deified image of Zhou Enlai.\n\n'He even secretly protected a large number of capitalists during the most intense moments of the 'Cultural Revolution'. And his adopted son, Li Peng, whom he promoted, later participated in the 'Tiananmen Massacre' and became an executioner. Comrades, can we allow such a person to be called the 'People's Premier'?' Li Hao raises his voice, slamming his laser pointer on the podium.\n\nThe screen changes, showing a photo of Chen Yun. 'What about Chen Yun? Don’t think of him as just a 'quiet economist'. He is the inventor of the 'birdcage economy'! What is the birdcage economy? It's about using an invisible cage to trap the people's labor and creativity, turning state-owned enterprises into ATMs for the privileged. He fostered an economic privileged class, nominally preserving state-owned enterprises, but actually allowing these privileged individuals to embezzle national funds!'\n\n'Now,' Li Hao’s tone grows colder, 'Let’s go to a more recent period in history—the 1989 'June 4th' incident. Today's targets of denunciation include not only the deceased, but also the living—those who participated in the massacre, the suppression of students and citizens. Li Peng and the government he represented were the direct executors of the massacre order, and standing by him were loyal dogs trained by the Zhou Enlai and Chen Yun system. They used tanks and bullets against the people, using bloodshed to protect their rule!'\n\nFrom the audience, a low, angry growl can be heard. 'These people should have been brought to justice long ago!'\n\n'Yes, comrades,' Li Hao continues, 'June 4th was not an isolated event. It was the inevitable result of decades of the special socialist line. From Zhou Enlai to Chen Yun to Li Peng, this line clearly shows that the so-called 'socialism with Chinese characteristics' was essentially a scam against the people!'\n\nHe pauses, scanning the faces in the crowd that are slowly ignited with anger. 'But every scam will eventually be exposed. Today, we will peel off this painted skin and expose the truth to the sunlight. For these historical criminals, whether dead or alive, we will hold them accountable, and make them pay for their actions!'\n\nThe room erupts in applause and angry shouts, 'Bring them to justice! Completely bring them to justice!'\n\nLi Hao nods and concludes, 'Comrades, this is just the beginning. The next task is to make these people's crimes public, completely strip away their mythic halos, and show the people their true faces. We must tell the world with the truth: History will not forgive, and the people will not forget!'\n\nThe room is filled with thunderous applause, as everyone's hearts are lit by the same belief:"

PRC_MAO.87.t:0 "Xi's Leftist Re-Education"
PRC_MAO.87.d:0 "The dim classroom lights cast a shadow on the floor, illuminating the faces of young people full of rebellious emotion. This is one of the newly established ideological re-education centers after the revolution, and today’s topic is the 'Four Types of People'—those who are called 'Xi Leftists' and are gathered here for collective education. These people may be the last group of enthusiasts for 'Chinese socialism with Chinese characteristics' in the twenty-first century.\n\n'Let me tell you something, without Comrade Deng’s reform and opening up, and without Chairman Xi’s great rejuvenation dream, there would be no China today! You so-called revolutionaries are simply ungrateful!' Zhang Xu stands in the corner of the classroom, shaking his fist with indignation. His voice is particularly jarring in the small space.\n\nSun Wenjie, the youth lecturer in charge of today’s re-education course, furrows his brows slightly. He looks at this young man, knowing that Zhang Xu is not an isolated case. People like him mostly come from the past university campuses, having been detached from actual labor for too long, accustomed to hollow words in books and blind worship of authority. They have read some 'theories', but completely ignore the exploitation and oppression in the real world. The most troubling part is that they firmly believe they are 'defending the truth' and are hostile to any opposing views.\n\n'Zhang Xu, do you think that without Deng Xiaoping’s reform and opening up, or Xi Jinping’s leadership, China would have fallen into decline?' Sun Wenjie speaks gently, but with a sharp edge.\n\n'Isn’t that the case?' Zhang Xu’s eyes widen as if offended, 'Without reform and opening up, how would we have today's economic prosperity? Without Chairman Xi, how would we have China’s international position today? You people are simply trying to deny history!'\n\n'Economic prosperity?' Sun Wenjie sighs, turns around, and writes several large characters on the blackboard: 'The Cost of Reform and Opening Up.' He turns back and looks at the entire class, 'Reform and opening up did bring economic growth, but what was its cost? Tens of millions of migrant workers flooded into cities, only to live in slums and earn meager wages to support their families; the privatization of state-owned enterprises left countless workers unemployed while capitalists became richer by the day; the ecological environment was severely damaged, and the lives of the working class were utterly crushed. Do you think this is prosperity?'\n\nZhang Xu is speechless, his lips moving but no words coming out.\n\nOther students begin whispering. Sitting in the back, Li Qianqian raises her hand, her voice trembling but firm, 'But Chairman Xi said that we should achieve 'comprehensive well-off' and 'targeted poverty alleviation'. Aren’t these policies for the good of the people?'\n\nSun Wenjie nods. 'Targeted poverty alleviation has indeed helped some people temporarily escape poverty, but I ask you, why were these people poor? Was it in their destiny? No, it was caused by the previous so-called 'socialist system with Chinese characteristics'. Poverty alleviation is a remedy, but it was never the fundamental solution. The real problem is the system itself—it still exploits, just in a different form. What you see as 'great policies' are merely poison coated in sugar.'\n\nLi Qianqian lowers her head and says no more. Zhang Xu suddenly stands up and shouts loudly, 'You are just blackening the names of Comrade Deng and Chairman Xi! Without their reform and opening up, China would never have escaped poverty! You revolutionaries are simply traitors to the country!'\n\nSun Wenjie looks at him and smiles faintly, 'Zhang Xu, you say that reform and opening up lifted China out of poverty, so let me ask you, whose poverty are you talking about? Who is wealthy? Who is poor? Do you really think that the wealth gained by capitalists through exploiting workers represents the strength of the country? Our revolution today is to return what belongs to the people to the people, not to allow a small group of capitalists and bureaucrats to continue exploiting us.'\n\nZhang Xu's face turns red with anger, mumbling but unable to retort.\n\nSitting on the side, Zhao Yunpeng, who has been silent until now, suddenly sneers, 'I’ve always said, these 'Xi Leftists' are living in books. They look at 'comprehensive well-off societies' every day, but they’ve never even stepped into a factory, so they don’t know what life is really like for the working class.'\n\nZhang Xu whips his head around, glaring at Zhao Yunpeng, 'You’re the one living in a fantasy! Chairman Xi has made China strong, and you’re not grateful, but here you are talking about workers!'\n\n'Grateful?' Zhao Yunpeng raises an eyebrow, mocking, 'My parents worked in factories all their lives, and after the factory restructured, they were laid off without even a pension. In those years, how did they survive? With 'reform and opening up'? Don’t kid me. They survived on their sweat and tears, and eventually, through this revolution, they were able to rise again. You say I’m not grateful? I want to ask, who should I be grateful to?'\n\nThe classroom falls silent. Zhang Xu clenches his fists, his face red, and his mouth moves, but no words come out.\n\nSun Wenjie sighs and taps the blackboard, 'Comrades, I know that changing a person’s deeply ingrained beliefs isn’t easy. For decades, 'Chinese socialism' used powerful propaganda to build countless lies, packaging exploitation and oppression as 'development' and 'progress', making many people believe them. But I hope you will remember, the purpose of revolution is not to deny anyone, but to achieve true justice and fairness. We need not blind worship, but clear recognition.'\n\nHe pauses, his gaze falling on Zhang Xu, 'You are all smart people, and I hope you can think for yourselves, instead of blindly repeating what’s in the books. Today's class ends here, and next time we will continue.'\n\nZhang Xu doesn’t say anything more, but his gaze remains defiant. He lowers his head and walks out of the classroom silently. The others leave one by one, and Li Qianqian stands at the door, lost in thought, looking at the words 'cost' on the blackboard.\n\nSun Wenjie walks over to the window, looking at the setting sun, and sighs softly:"

PRC_MAO.86.t:0 "Feminism"
PRC_MAO.86.d:0 "The atmosphere at the activity center today is a little off. Old Liu arrived early, but instead of rushing to sit in the front row like usual, he quietly sat in the back with a gloomy expression. He knows today’s topic is feminism, and it’s another one of those tricky issues that could easily backfire. He’s already made a few embarrassing mistakes in previous meetings and doesn’t want to cause any more trouble. What makes him even more uncomfortable is that a few 'big, strong' women have shown up, dressed in fancy clothes, exuding an air of superiority. Old Liu can’t help but frown, thinking, these women look tough to deal with.\n\nSun Wei stands at the podium, opens the lesson slides, and starts with a smile, 'Today we’re going to talk about feminism. This topic is very important, and it’s relevant to everyone’s lives. Let’s first talk about what true feminism is.'\n\nBefore he can finish, a plump woman in the front row cuts in with a sharp, smug voice, 'Feminism? Feminism means men should spend money on us women! Look, the bride price should be enough, right? After marriage, the man should earn money to support the family, and the woman should stay home, rest, shop, and enjoy life.'\n\nAnother woman chimes in, 'Exactly! If the man can give more, it proves he has ability and is worthy of us. That’s what equality is!'\n\nThe room immediately erupts in murmurs. Among the young people, a few mutter 'A toad trying to eat a swan’s meat', and someone can’t help but roll their eyes, 'This is just like those 'little fairies' online, never thought I’d see them in real life.'\n\nOld Liu clenches his fists, ready to stand up and shout. He’s so angry that his face turns red, thinking to himself, 'If Sun Wei tries to defend these women, I’ll embarrass myself and tear them apart!'\n\nHowever, just as he’s about to stand up, Sun Wei speaks first. His voice isn’t loud, but every word strikes like a needle, directly popping the bubble of confidence these women had, 'What you just said is not feminism, and it’s not real equality. To be honest, your thinking is no different from patriarchy.'\n\nThe women are stunned, not expecting Sun Wei to confront them like this. 'How could that be! What we’re saying is feminism. Why should men have all the benefits, while women suffer?'\n\nSun Wei sighs, continues, 'True feminism is about pursuing equality between men and women, not about one gender exploiting the other. What you’re saying, 'Men should work and support the family, while women enjoy life' is essentially the same as the old patriarchy’s 'Men rule, women obey'. The only difference is, in the past women passively accepted it, but now you are trying to demand it. But fundamentally, women still don’t have independence, nor do they gain equal rights through labor.'\n\n'Labor?' One woman scoffs, 'Why should women work? Men should support us.'\n\n'Then where does your freedom and dignity come from?' Sun Wei asks sharply, 'If one day he doesn’t want to support you, or if he thinks you’re 'not obedient enough', what will you do? Only through work and economic independence can women truly achieve equality and dignity. What you want is just another form of dependency.'\n\nA few young people laugh lowly, muttering, 'It’s just like those 'femininists', only a different gender.'\n\nSun Wei ignores the mocking voices, continuing, 'Also, the bride price issue was abolished after the revolution. Now we live in socialism, where there’s no such severe wealth inequality, and marriage is based on equality and love. You’re still talking about bride prices; isn’t that a bit outdated?'"

PRC_MAO.86.a:0 "Finally, I don’t have to make a fool of myself today."


PRC_MAO.85.t:0 "Socialism"
PRC_MAO.85.d:0 "Today, Sun Wei's volunteer 'literacy' class started on time, with the theme 'Public Ownership and Socialist Economy.' The activity center was still filled with people. Old Liu arrived early this time and chose a prominent seat. As he sat watching the podium, he silently encouraged himself: 'I can’t make another mistake this time. Last time, the Confucian-Legalist debate made me look foolish and embarrassed—I can’t let that happen again.'\n\nTo prevent another slip-up, he went to borrow the teaching materials from Sun Wei yesterday and thoroughly prepared, especially remembering the key points Sun Wei had emphasized, such as 'Public ownership is not egalitarianism' and 'Socialism cannot be a communal pot.' He had memorized them so well that he even dreamed of standing at the podium, speaking eloquently and leaving everyone speechless, basking in glory.\n\nSun Wei had just begun introducing the basic concept of public ownership when some of the older attendees couldn’t hold back. An elderly man in a blue coat spoke first: 'Little Sun, I remember back then, we used to say public ownership is like a communal pot, everyone gets the same whether they work more or less, and that didn’t work in the end, did it?' \n\n'Exactly!' Another elderly man joined in, 'I’ve heard things like 'Three ducks in a society, four ducks in assets.' Isn’t that exactly it! Public ownership sounds good, but in the end, doesn’t it just mean everyone gets lazy and doesn’t want to work?' \n\nBefore Sun Wei could explain, a young man sitting beside them suddenly stood up, speaking with strong disdain: 'I told you, this is all just a utopia. You want to create equality for everyone, but in the end, it all becomes hell! The market is the source of freedom—only when the market is free can the people be free!'\n\nOld Liu immediately furrowed his brows. After holding back for a while, he finally couldn’t help himself and slammed the table as he stood up, 'What do you all know?! Public ownership is not a communal pot, nor is it a utopia. You need to get it straight!'\n\nThe room instantly went silent. Everyone turned to look at Old Liu, especially the young man, whose face was filled with shock. Old Liu straightened his back as if he had been waiting for his moment to shine, his voice booming, 'Let me ask you, can a communal pot work for production? No! As Teacher Sun said, our current public ownership is not the old 'same for everyone regardless of effort' nonsense. We now have planning and organization, allocating resources based on the actual conditions of different regions. Those who work more, get more! If you don’t work, don’t expect to get anything!'\n\nSome people started whispering, and Old Liu got even more fired up, bringing up everything he had reviewed the previous night: 'And those of you who say 'market freedom equals people’s freedom,' I ask you, where’s the freedom when capitalists exploit workers? Those bosses used to pay workers three thousand a month and take millions in bonuses themselves, and you’re telling me this is freedom? Our public ownership lets the workers take charge! The factory is ours, the leadership is elected by us, and the profits go to us—that’s real freedom!'\n\nAfter saying this, Old Liu looked at the young people who still wanted to argue, giving a cold snort, 'Don’t try to talk to me about those useless theories. I’ve lived this long and never seen a capitalist who really cares about the common people!'\n\nSun Wei stood at the podium, watching Old Liu’s impromptu performance and couldn’t help but smile. He raised his hand to signal for quiet, 'Everyone, please calm down. We’re here to discuss issues, not to argue. I think Old Liu made some valid points, but I still want to explain public ownership in a more straightforward way.'\n\nSun Wei took a pen and drew a simple diagram on the blackboard, 'Imagine a large reservoir. The water in it represents our social resources. Public ownership is like this, where everyone manages the water together. Everyone has the right to take from it but also the duty to contribute to it. What was private ownership like? The key to the reservoir was held by a few people, and only they could decide how much water others could drink.'\n\nThe room fell silent. A few workers nodded, clearly understanding the metaphor.\n\n'But,' Sun Wei continued, 'if public ownership is not properly managed, for example, if there are no rules and anyone can take as much as they want, the water will run out, and in the end, no one will get anything. So today’s public ownership is about planning and fair distribution. Those who work hard and contribute more will definitely receive more, and those who temporarily face difficulties won’t starve because we have a safety net.'\n\nA middle-aged worker raised his hand and asked, 'Teacher Sun, now our factory is also under public ownership, does this mean all factories will be like this in the future?' \n\nSun Wei nodded, 'Yes, your factory is currently operating under this model. The leadership is elected by everyone, and resources and income are made public. Everyone can supervise. This avoids the exploitation by capitalists from the past and the flaws of the old communal pot system.'\n\nThe young man who had spoken earlier muttered in disagreement, 'Sounds like a fantasy, does it really work?' \n\n'If it works or not, you can check your wallet later.' Old Liu replied coldly, turning to look at Sun Wei with a proud expression.\n\nSun Wei couldn’t help but smile and patted Old Liu on the shoulder, 'Old Liu, you did great today, but everyone can still ask questions. The more we discuss, the deeper our understanding will be.'\n\nOld Liu straightened his back with satisfaction,"

PRC_MAO.84.t:0 "Patriotism"
PRC_MAO.84.d:0 "The activity center is especially lively today. Old Liu arrived early and secured a good front-row seat, sitting up straighter than anyone else. He had fully prepared for today, borrowing the teaching materials from Sun Wei several times in advance. Although there were still some parts he didn’t fully understand, he knew the topic today was 'Patriotism.' This topic had nothing to do with the embarrassing superstitions from before, and he had already mentally prepared himself—today, he would make up for the times he had been 'silenced' during class.\n\nSun Wei stood on the stage, flipped through the slides, glanced at the audience, and smiled slightly, 'As everyone knows, today we’re going to talk about patriotism. Loving our country is something everyone agrees on, but what does true patriotism mean? We need to discuss this.'\n\nAs soon as he finished speaking, a young man in a brightly colored hoodie jumped up, his face flushed with excitement. 'I’ll speak!' His voice was loud, and his words came quickly, 'Patriotism means China is the strongest! People from neighboring countries, all they do is steal our things or rob our culture, they’re always envious of us! They’re just a bunch of spineless people!'\n\nAs soon as he finished, several elderly people nodded, and Old Liu couldn’t help but mutter under his breath, 'This young man does have a point. Some countries really do keep their eyes on us.' However, Old Liu didn’t dare to say it too loudly since he remembered what Sun Wei had previously said about 'opposing prejudice,' which didn’t really align with today’s theme.\n\nHowever, the young man seemed to get more and more agitated, completely unaware of Old Liu’s hesitation. He continued, 'I think, those people in the neighboring countries are not good either! Only China is the best country in the world! Anyone who disagrees is a traitor!'\n\nSun Wei had been quietly listening, waiting for the young man to finish before slowly responding, 'This classmate, when you say patriotism, are you just loving a symbol, or are you just chanting slogans? Let me ask you, is patriotism about loving the people of this land, or about loving some abstract concept of a "strongest country"?' \n\nThe young man froze for a moment, 'Of course, it’s about loving the country! When the country is strong, the people will live better!'\n\n'And after the country is strong?' Sun Wei spoke calmly, but each word felt like a stone hitting the ground, 'When the country is strong, does that mean you can insult the people of other countries at will? You say those people from neighboring countries are not good, but do you know that their government might be bad, but that doesn’t mean their people are bad? Just like when we opposed the old government in the past, we were just ordinary people, weren’t we?' \n\nThe room went silent, and a few workers nodded. One of them, named Wang Jianguo, spoke up, 'Teacher Sun is right. In the past, when capitalists exploited us, many people said workers 'deserved it.' Isn’t this the same logic? I really don’t like this 'patriotic rhetoric,' sometimes it sounds like it’s meant for those in power to hear.'\n\n'Right!' Another young man, Wang Chen, added with a sarcastic tone, 'I just want to ask, those who always shouted 'a strong nation' before the revolution, making workers swallow their anger, now everything has changed, and they’re still pretending to be the most 'patriotic'? Isn’t this the same as those 'fangirls'? Same thing, just a different packaging!' \n\nThe young man in the hoodie’s face turned bright red. He pointed at Wang Chen and shouted, 'You’re the fangirl! You’re all traitors! You have no idea what patriotism really means!' \n\n'Traitors?' Wang Chen sneered, retorting coldly, 'We now have leaders chosen by workers, leading the charge. We have workers’ rights, and life is getting better every day. You come here and call us traitors? I think you’re the one who’s just spouting slogans to get a free meal!' \n\n'You!' The young man in the hoodie stomped his feet angrily. He clearly couldn’t win the argument with Wang Chen, but he refused to admit defeat.\n\nAt this moment, Old Liu unexpectedly remained quiet, sitting in his seat watching the whole scene, a small, secretive smile forming on his lips. He looked up at Sun Wei with a smug expression as if saying, 'See, I’ve been good today.'\n\nSun Wei sighed, raising his hand to signal for quiet, 'Comrades, the core of patriotism is love for the people, not blind worship of an abstract national symbol. It’s not about proving your correctness by insulting others. Our revolution’s goal is to help the people live better lives, not to uphold some false 'authority' or illusion.'\n\nHe paused for a moment, his gaze lingering on the young man in the hoodie before continuing, 'If anyone, in the name of patriotism, stirs up hatred, creates division, or uses these emotions to harm innocent people, that is truly betraying patriotism.'\n\nThe young man stared at Sun Wei, wanting to say something, but swallowed his words. He glared at Wang Chen and the others before finally sitting down, sulking and playing with his phone without saying another word.\n\nOld Liu watched this, unable to hold back a chuckle, 'Teacher Sun, I didn’t say a word today! This kid is even more embarrassing than I was last time!' \n\nLaughter erupted from the audience, and even Sun Wei couldn’t help but shake his head, smiling."
PRC_MAO.84.a:0 "Although the process was a bit bumpy, today’s lesson seems to have been more successful than he expected."

PRC_MAO.83.t:0 "Criticizing Confucius"
PRC_MAO.83.d:0 "In the community activity center’s multifunction hall, Sun Wei stood at the podium, starting today’s volunteer 'literacy' lesson. He cleared his throat and glanced over at Old Liu sitting in the front row. After several clashes in the past, Old Liu was unusually quiet this time, sitting straight in his chair, with a slight tension in his expression. However, when Sun Wei announced today’s theme—criticizing Confucius—he seemed to find his opportunity.\n\n'Confucius’ thoughts have influenced China for over two thousand years,' Sun Wei said slowly, 'but his teachings essentially served the feudal ruling system. His 'Three Principles and Five Constants' reinforced the hierarchical system and oppressed countless laborers. Today, we are here to criticize these feudal ideas to help everyone understand how they hindered social progress.'\n\n'I’m familiar with this!' As soon as Sun Wei finished, Old Liu suddenly stood up with a hint of smugness in his tone. 'Chairman Mao said back in the day, we should criticize Confucianism and Mencius! This isn’t anything new. Back then, I attended struggle sessions every day, really getting excited about it!' \n\nSun Wei paused for a moment, not sure how to respond, but before he could, Old Liu got more and more excited, 'To me, Confucius’ teachings just supported the landlords! Look at our Qin Shi Huang, how majestic! He unified the six states, burned books, and buried scholars, getting rid of all those hypocritical Confucian scholars! You young people don’t understand, this is real innovation! If it were in the great Qin, all this feudal etiquette would have been wiped out!' \n\nAs soon as Sun Wei heard 'Qin Shi Huang,' a strange feeling flashed in his heart. He raised his head and cautiously replied, 'Old Liu, I understand you want to say that Qin Shi Huang ended the divisions, which was indeed an achievement. But… did you know, Qin Shi Huang was also a feudal emperor, and his rule was still based on the oppression of the working people, such as forced labor, taxes, and the deaths of countless common people when building the Great Wall…'\n\n'You’re wrong!' Old Liu suddenly waved his hand, eyebrows raised in anger. 'Qin Shi Huang unified the country, he followed the legalist path and emphasized rules! Unlike Confucius, who always talked about ethics and virtue, just deceptive nonsense. Chairman Mao even praised Qin Shi Huang. How can you young people refute Chairman Mao’s words?' \n\nSun Wei was momentarily speechless. He had expected the discussion to be difficult, but Old Liu’s sudden challenge caught him off guard. After a pause, he carefully chose his words, 'Old Liu, I have great respect for Chairman Mao, but I believe we should look at things with a historical materialist perspective. Chairman Mao praised Qin Shi Huang because he saw certain historical contributions. However, that doesn’t mean we should ignore the oppression of the working people under Qin Shi Huang’s rule.' \n\n'Are you saying Chairman Mao was wrong?' Old Liu’s voice suddenly rose, and his face turned pale as if his sensitive spot had been touched. He stood up, leaning on the back of the chair, his voice filled with suppressed anger, 'You dare say Chairman Mao was wrong? If Chairman Mao heard what you young people are saying, how heartbroken would he be!' \n\nSun Wei sighed inwardly but maintained his calm, 'Old Liu, I’m not denying Chairman Mao. We just need to analyze things with dialectical materialism. Chairman Mao taught us to seek truth from facts, and to analyze things dialectically. Qin Shi Huang’s legalist philosophy did promote some historical progress, but we must also acknowledge that his rule had deep issues. Our criticism of feudal ideas is not to deny history, but to learn from it, and make a better future.' \n\nOld Liu opened his mouth, seemingly wanting to refute something, but in the end, no words came out. He looked around, noticing that none of the workers around him spoke up for him, some even secretly smiling. He paused, then angrily pulled his chair back and sat down. His face still held anger, but he said nothing further.\n\nWang Jianguo, sitting in the corner, suddenly spoke up, 'Old Liu, I think Teacher Sun is right. Back in Qin Shi Huang’s time, we common people, the farmers, weren’t better off than we are now. If the revolution hadn’t succeeded, we’d still be serving those boss capitalists! Now we elect our own leaders, and life is so much more comfortable!' \n\nAfter these words, several workers nodded, and some even whispered, 'It’s definitely much better now. I really don’t want to go back to those days.' \n\nOld Liu’s face darkened as he heard these words, but in the end, he only snorted and said nothing more.\n\nSun Wei looked at Old Liu’s back, feeling a complex mix of emotions. He knew that changing someone’s deeply ingrained beliefs couldn’t be done with just one or two sentences. But he also understood that these small clashes and reflections were what would help more people awaken.\n\n'We still have a long way to go,' he whispered to himself as he flipped to the next slide."
PRC_MAO.83.a:0 "Let’s not mention the Confucian-Legalist debate anymore..."

PRC_MAO.82.t:0 "Farce"
PRC_MAO.82.d:0 "The community activity center was once again packed with people, and Sun Wei stood at the podium, glancing at the audience below. He noticed that Old Liu had returned, but this time, he was accompanied by a young man. The young man was dressed in a retro long gown, his hair neatly combed, and his eyes carried a touch of defiance. He seemed to notice Sun Wei’s gaze and gave a contemptuous smile.\n\n'Today's topic is women's rights,' Sun Wei began, his voice calm yet filled with strength. 'We need to talk about why women's freedom and rights are an essential part of our social progress.'\n\nSome people nodded, while others were indifferent. Old Liu clearly belonged to the latter group. He leaned back in his chair, his expression filled with impatience, even rolling his eyes slightly. Sun Wei sighed internally but decided to ignore it for now.\n\n'In our new society, women no longer have to endure oppression. They can freely choose their careers, lives, and marriages. We have discarded outdated customs, such as 'women shouldn’t sit at the table' or 'more children bring more blessings,' right?' he said, trying to keep his tone light.\n\n'Who said that?' The young man suddenly stood up, his voice sharp. 'Women should be tied down! What freedom, what rights, you’re laughing at me! 'The curtain blade' should have been cut long ago, leaving them is a disaster!'\n\nIn an instant, the entire hall fell eerily silent, as if the air had frozen. All eyes turned to the young man, shock, anger, and disbelief written across everyone’s face. Even Old Liu, who usually loved to argue, was frozen for a moment, his face turning pale.\n\n'What nonsense are you talking!' Old Liu slammed the chair and stood up, his voice full of rage. 'Who taught you this? Are you out of your mind?'\n\nThe young man was momentarily stunned by Old Liu’s reaction but quickly shouted back, 'Old Liu, didn’t you say we should preserve tradition? This is tradition! Women are naturally inferior to men, their duty is to obey!'\n\n'You’re talking nonsense!' Old Liu almost wanted to slap him. 'I brought you here to help me reason, not to make a fool of yourself in front of everyone!'\n\n'Tradition?' Liu Fang, who had been sitting quietly in the corner, suddenly stood up, sneering. 'Why don’t you explain, what tradition? Men hitting women? Women not sitting at the table? Or the girls in the family not being allowed to speak?' \n\n'Shut up!' The young man shouted, his face turning red. 'People like you don’t understand tradition, what qualification do you have to speak?'\n\n'Qualification?' Wang Chen also stood up, his gaze as sharp as a knife. 'Are you here to make jokes? The new society has already been built, and you’re still talking about those old feudal rules! If you really have the guts, go back to your old-fashioned life and stop polluting our ears with your nonsense!'\n\nThe scene became chaotic, and Old Liu trembled in anger. 'Teacher Sun, I really fell for it! I thought this kid would say something useful, but he’s a complete lunatic!'\n\nSun Wei had been trying to suppress his emotions, but when he heard the phrase 'the curtain blade should have been cut long ago,' he couldn’t hold it back any longer. He walked up to the young man, stared into his eyes, and spoke coldly, 'Do you know what you just said? You are denying half of humanity’s worth. You are insulting your mother, insulting all those who have contributed to this society!'\n\nThe young man opened his mouth to reply but was cut off by the sound of footsteps coming from outside the door. A few members of the Youth Patrol team walked in, and the leader nodded at Sun Wei before turning to the young man. 'You are suspected of spreading counter-revolutionary remarks and insulting women’s rights. Please come with us.' \n\n'Why are you arresting me! What did I say wrong?!' The young man struggled and shouted, but his voice was quickly drowned out by the angry voices from the crowd. Even Old Liu couldn’t help but shout, 'You’ve really embarrassed me! I should have never brought you here!'\n\nThe patrol team took the young man away, and the atmosphere in the room remained heavy. Sun Wei returned to the podium, took a deep breath, and calmed himself.\n\n'Comrades, today’s incident may make everyone uncomfortable, but I want to say that this is precisely why we need to promote literacy. The poison of feudal thinking is still affecting some people. It prevents them from seeing the brightness of the new society and the equal value of each person. But we cannot retreat, we cannot allow these cancers to re-emerge.'\n\nWang Jianguo, sitting in the corner, nodded and sighed. 'Indeed, our life now is much better than before. Although some of the new rules are a bit confusing, I know, in the end, they are meant to make life fairer for everyone.'\n\nOld Liu sat back in his chair and muttered under his breath, 'Teacher Sun, I was wrong, this kid really is a disaster.'\n\nSun Wei glanced at him, nodded, and said nothing further. He packed up his materials and walked out of the activity center. By the time he looked up at the gradually darkening sky, a sense of bitterness rose in his heart."
PRC_MAO.82.a:0 "What’s going on here? Is this still the New China?"

PRC_MAO.81.t:0 "Breaking Superstition"
PRC_MAO.81.d:0 "Today is Sun Wei's first day participating in the volunteer 'literacy' campaign, held at a community activity center in a small county in Shandong. Sunlight filters through the dim windows, casting light on a worn wooden table where dozens of people are seated, including some older faces, younger faces, and several workers quietly listening from the side. Sun Wei stands at the front, nervously squeezing the teaching materials in his hands. He knows this lesson won't be easy.\n\nAt the start, the atmosphere is relatively cordial, and Sun Wei begins the first topic with a smile. 'Today, we’re going to talk about feudal superstitions in daily life. For example, some people say that you shouldn’t stick chopsticks upright into rice because it invites “unclean things.” Do you think this is true?' \n\n'That’s not superstition, that’s just a rule!' An old man suddenly speaks up, his name is Old Liu, and his voice carries an unquestionable tone. 'Sticking chopsticks in rice is for the dead, no living person should do that!' \n\nSun Wei patiently explains, 'Old Liu, what you’re saying is something from the past, and it’s actually rooted in a reverence for the deceased. But today, sticking chopsticks in rice doesn’t bring anything 'unclean.' In fact, the chopsticks and rice we use today, made through automated processes, are very clean. Science tells us that this is just a habit, unrelated to ghosts or gods.' \n\n'Unrelated to ghosts and gods? What do you know, kid!' Old Liu raises his eyebrows, clearly displeased. 'Young people always think they know everything. You can’t just throw away the traditions passed down by our ancestors.' \n\nThe atmosphere becomes tense. Wang Chen, a young man sitting nearby, stands up, smiles slightly, and says, 'Old Liu, I don’t agree with that. We’re not saying we should discard all traditions, but we should discard those meaningless rules. You say chopsticks shouldn’t be stuck in rice, but when I was in elementary school, I did it several times by accident, and I’m still fine!' \n\n'You brat!' Old Liu gets anxious, slamming his hand on the chair. 'This is nothing but a lack of upbringing! Always using 'modern' as an excuse!' \n\n'Upbringing is about respecting people, not blindly following meaningless rules!' Wang Chen retorts. 'We’re living better now, thanks to science, thanks to everyone’s collective effort, not thanks to these outdated superstitions!' \n\nSun Wei quickly intervenes to ease the tension, 'Let’s continue. For example, how about the superstition that you shouldn’t flip a fish over while eating it? Has anyone heard of that one?' \n\n'Of course!' Zhao Dama, an elderly woman sitting nearby, adds, 'Flipping a fish means the ship will flip, it means things won’t go smoothly!' \n\n'Zhao Dama, actually, this is a fisherman’s superstition,' Sun Wei tries to lighten the tone, 'In the old days, fishermen feared their boats would capsize, so they avoided flipping fish. But now, we’re not on fishing boats, and there’s no risk of capsizing. So can we stop taking this superstition so seriously?' \n\n'Exactly! Flipping a fish can’t possibly cause disaster!' Wang Chen can’t help but add. \n\n'You young people!' Zhao Dama gives Wang Chen a harsh look. 'How come you don’t understand respecting tradition?' \n\nThe tension rises again, and Sun Wei tries to ease the situation, 'Actually, what we’re discussing today isn’t about saying tradition is bad, but we want to show that some traditions can be adapted to modern times to better serve our lives.' \n\n'How about patriarchy, is that 'tradition'?' Liu Fang, who had been silent, suddenly speaks up. She is Wang Chen’s fellow villager and also a participant in this literacy campaign. Her voice is cold, and her gaze is fixed on Old Liu. 'When I was a child, my family was poor, my brother went to school, and I stayed home doing the washing and cooking. When I grew up, my father found me a husband, and I married him without even meeting him first. Is this still called tradition?' \n\nOld Liu is momentarily stunned and opens his mouth but can’t find the words. \n\n'I’ve had enough.' Liu Fang’s tone grows more intense. 'Now, the new laws clearly state that arranged marriages are illegal, and parents can’t interfere with their children’s romantic freedom. You can say I’m going against tradition, but I don’t care! Isn’t our revolution all about changing these suffering 'traditions'?' \n\nThe scene completely erupts. Old Liu’s face turns red with anger, and he suddenly stands up, slamming his chair to the ground. 'You unfilial children! You don’t want to recognize your ancestors, do you?!' With that, he storms out of the room. \n\nThe room falls silent, and you can almost hear everyone’s breath. After a moment, Wang Jianguo, a middle-aged worker sitting in the corner, scratches his head and chuckles, 'Actually, I don’t really understand all these ideas, but I know one thing. Since our revolution, we no longer have to bribe people to elect leaders, workers have a voice, and life is much better than before. So even if I don’t fully understand what you’re saying, I think it’s probably good for us.' \n\nSun Wei looks at Wang Jianguo, moved. He nods slightly, then turns to Liu Fang and the other young people, 'Thank you for your support and for raising these issues. The road of revolution is long. Today, we may not have convinced everyone, but as long as we keep going, more people will understand.' \n\nAs the sky darkens, the light in the activity center stretches out everyone’s shadows. Sun Wei packs up his materials and, as he walks out, looks back at the center. There’s a mixture of bitterness and hope in his heart. He realizes this literacy campaign isn’t just about spreading knowledge; it’s a clash between the old and the new. And this road will never be smooth.'"
PRC_MAO.81.a:0 "It will get easier."

PRC_MAO.80.t:0 "Civic Rights Literacy"
PRC_MAO.80.d:0 "Today is Chen Xiaoming’s first day participating in the volunteer 'literacy' campaign. His task is to explain the key elements of the 'second literacy' plan to the community workers—civil rights and the popularization of scientific knowledge. It’s a warm morning, and the multifunctional hall of the community activity center is already filled with people. The audience includes factory workers, newly graduated young people, and several elderly individuals. They have different expressions, but they all seem somewhat interested in the special course today.\n\nChen Xiaoming steps up to the podium, takes a deep breath, and feels a little sweaty in his palms. He remembers his colleague who organized the event advising him: 'Don’t be too dogmatic, they’re not blank slates. Many of them have more experience than you.' So, he smiles and cracks a small joke, 'Today’s theme is literacy, but don’t misunderstand—I’m not here to teach you how to 'read and write.' Just look at the people in the audience, who isn’t an experienced revolutionary? Words have long been etched in your minds! Today, we’re going to talk about something else—how to make good use of our rights, and some little scientific facts.' \n\nLaughter breaks out in the crowd, and the atmosphere becomes much lighter.\n\n'Let’s start with the most interesting topic: civil rights.' Chen Xiaoming flips open his presentation slides, and several key terms appear on the screen: freedom of speech, right to vote and be elected, right to strike, right to protest, revolutionary rights.\n\n'Let’s start with 'freedom of speech'!' He looks over the crowd and asks, 'Does anyone want to start by explaining what 'freedom' really means?' \n\n'It means being able to speak the truth.' A middle-aged man in work clothes speaks up. His name is Li Jianjun, a technician at the factory and a member of the elected management committee. He continues, 'Back when the capitalists were in charge, we workers couldn’t say a word. If anyone raised an objection, they’d lose their job the next day. But after the revolution, we elected our own management committee, and if there’s something we don’t like, we can bring it up directly in a meeting. This is freedom of speech!' \n\nChen Xiaoming nods, 'Exactly, freedom of speech is just like you said, you don’t have to fear capitalist oppression anymore. But this freedom has to be used properly. For example, if someone in the factory spreads rumors, saying 'the elected factory leaders are corrupt,' but there’s no evidence, would that be an abuse of freedom?' \n\n'Of course not!' A young man, Wang Yuyang, raises his hand. 'Freedom isn’t an excuse to spread lies! We need to speak logically, based on facts.' \n\nChen Xiaoming smiles, 'Exactly, that’s the point. Freedom of speech protects our right to speak the truth, but it doesn’t mean we can say anything we want, nor does it give us the right to harm others.' \n\n'So what about 'the right to vote'?' From the corner, an elderly worker, Hu Dage, grunts. 'Although I’m retired, when we used to elect factory leaders, I always thought... the young people’s choice of leaders wasn’t reliable. They lacked experience, they’re not as steady as us older folks.' \n\n'Hu Dage, that’s not right!' Wang Yuyang immediately counters. 'The right to vote means everyone gets an equal vote, regardless of age or position. Who becomes the leader is not determined by how old they are, but by whether they have the ability to lead everyone well!' \n\nSeeing the situation, Chen Xiaoming quickly steps in to smooth things over, 'Hu Dage, Wang Yuyang makes a good point. Elections are a collective matter, not a personal one. Experience is important, but the perspective of young people is equally important. They complement each other. Don’t worry, if the leader we elect isn’t doing well, we can always vote again!' \n\nThe crowd laughs lightly, and Hu Dage waves his hand, 'Alright, I’ll admit you’re right.' \n\nThe discussion then shifts to scientific knowledge. Chen Xiaoming changes the slide, showing an image of bacteria under a microscope. 'Scientific knowledge can change lives. For example, some people say you shouldn’t eat cold rice because it’s 'toxic.' Do you think this is true?' \n\n'Of course not.' Li Jianjun answers quickly. 'That’s just an old superstition. In the past, when conditions weren’t good and rice was left out too long, it grew bacteria. But now, with our automated kitchens and good preservation technology, how could it be toxic?' \n\n'Exactly, that’s the point.' Chen Xiaoming nods, 'Some superstitions are based on old experiences when conditions were poor, but with our advances in technology, superstitions should be left in the past. Scientific knowledge makes our lives more convenient and safe.' \n\n'I heard that keeping your phone next to your pillow will radiate your brain cells to death. Is that true?' A young girl raises her hand. \n\nChen Xiaoming laughs, 'That’s a common misconception. Phones do emit radiation, but it’s only a tiny fraction—less than 1% of a microwave’s radiation. It’s nowhere near enough to harm us. We shouldn’t believe everything we hear. We need to ask 'why' and verify the facts.' \n\nAt this point, a worker suddenly speaks up. 'Teacher Xiaoming, I have a practical question. We’ve talked about civil rights and science, but how do we ensure that these rights are not violated for ordinary people? For example, what if someone becomes a leader and turns bad, what do we do?' \n\nThe question brings an immediate silence to the hall. Chen Xiaoming thinks for a moment before responding with firm conviction, 'Through supervision, and through resistance. We have the right to strike, the right to protest, and the revolutionary right. Rights don’t fall from the sky, we workers have earned them, and we must defend them ourselves. No one can defend these rights for us. Only when we stand up, can we protect them.' \n\nApplause erupts in the hall. Hu Dage nods in agreement, murmuring, 'That makes sense.' \n\nThe first day of the volunteer literacy campaign ends with a passionate discussion. As Chen Xiaoming steps down from the podium, he suddenly has a new realization—these workers are not ignorant 'learners.' They have rich experiences, independent thoughts, and sometimes know better than him how to defend their rights. He’s not here to lecture them, but to learn and discuss together, to keep the revolutionary fire burning brighter.'"

PRC_MAO.79.t:0 "A Day of Volunteering"
PRC_MAO.79.d:0 "Wang Zhigang's first day of volunteer work didn’t go as smoothly as he had hoped.\n\n'Ah, I’m late.' He got off the bus and hurriedly ran toward the factory gate, still holding a slightly worn safety helmet. Last night, he had stayed up late preparing lessons and accidentally stayed up until three in the morning. As a result, he didn’t hear the alarm when it went off in the morning. Given this situation, he had already prepared himself for a reprimand from the workers.\n\nHowever, when he gasped for breath and stepped into the factory, he was stunned by what he saw: several workers were gathered in the corner, laughing while watching videos on their phones, and others were leisurely sipping tea. There was none of the sternness or impatience he had imagined. Even more surprising, two workers in uniform arrived later than him, chatting as they walked in, without any sign of pressure from being late.\n\n'Hey, the new guy, right?' A middle-aged worker glanced at him and smiled, 'Don’t worry, it’s volunteer work. Being ten or eight minutes late is nothing. Our work efficiency is right there, and the automated equipment doesn’t rush us.' \n\nWang Zhigang opened his mouth but didn’t know what to say, so he awkwardly nodded. In his mind, however, various thoughts were swirling—this scene was completely different from what he had imagined.\n\nAfter changing into his work uniform, he was assigned to an automatic assembly line. Unlike the heavy physical labor he had expected, most of the work here was done by machines. The workers only needed to occasionally operate the control panel or replace some materials. His mentor, Lao Zhang, appeared to be around 40 years old, with a relaxed demeanor.\n\n'Operating this machine is very simple,' Lao Zhang pointed to the control station beside him, 'Just press this button to start. If anything goes wrong, the machine will alert us. Oh, be careful not to press this button; it will stop the machine.'\n\nWang Zhigang nodded vigorously, but he still felt a little nervous. He had just heard that this set of equipment was worth millions, and if he broke it, he wouldn’t know how to compensate for the damage.\n\nNot long after starting, his movements were stiff, and he was handling the equipment as though it were delicate china. Lao Zhang, watching from the side, suddenly laughed, 'Hey, you’re being too cautious. These machines aren’t that fragile. Don’t worry, I’ll cover for you if something goes wrong.' \n\nThis made Wang Zhigang feel a little more at ease, though his movements were still clumsy. Halfway through the work, Lao Zhang suddenly patted him on the shoulder, 'Take a break. I can see you’re sweating. By the way, what are you having for lunch? The cafeteria has braised pork ribs today.' \n\nWang Zhigang finally noticed that the people around him didn’t seem in a hurry to work. Some had already stopped, gathered together chatting, and others had even pulled out their phones to watch videos. He stared, wide-eyed, 'We can take a break now? Aren’t we in a rush to finish the work?' \n\nLao Zhang laughed loudly, 'Rush? The machine’s running. If you really stare at it for six hours, that’d be foolish. Our job isn’t tiring; it’s just monotonous. Occasionally chatting and relaxing is fine, otherwise, we’d go crazy in a day!' \n\nThis surprised Wang Zhigang. He had always thought that factory work should be tense and monotonous, but he didn’t expect the workers to have this kind of 'freedom.' \n\nAfter six hours, he had already mastered operating the automatic assembly machine, and in between, Lao Zhang took him for a cup of homemade herbal tea. Although he was physically tired, the resistance he had felt inside seemed to diminish significantly. \n\n'Come back again next time!' Lao Zhang smiled and waved as he watched him leave the factory.\n\nAs he walked out the factory gate, Wang Zhigang glanced back at the workshop, suddenly remembering the fear and anxiety he had felt about this day in the morning. He suddenly understood that this wasn’t the laborious, soul-crushing work he had imagined, but another way to integrate into society—a transition from the podium to reality.\n\n'It’s not that bad.' He muttered softly, a smile appearing on his face."

PRC_MAO.78.t:0 "The New Century Great Revolution: Report on the Southwestern Mountainous Areas"
PRC_MAO.78.d:0 "In the surging tide of the proletarian revolution in the new century, the revolutionary spark has spread across every inch of our homeland. However, beneath the banner of victory, we must confront a significant issue blocking the path to socialist construction: the deepening contradiction between the pre-modern clan societies in the southwestern mountainous areas and the emerging mass organizations, which has exposed the profound conflict between tradition and modernity. This conflict is not just a social phenomenon, but a battle of ideas and ideologies. We must recognize that this is not only about the fate of ethnic minorities, but also about the integrity of the proletarian revolution and the direction of history's forward march.\n\nFor a long time, certain ethnic minorities in the southwestern region have retained pre-modern ways of life, maintaining clan relationships based on blood ties. This social structure, while providing survival security in the past, has now become a heavy shackle preventing them from integrating into the socialist modernization process. The previous government’s so-called 'respect for traditional cultures' and 'protection of ethnic minorities' policy poured large sums of money into this, yet failed to truly guide them toward modernization. In reality, this approach merely trapped these minorities in a backward swamp, using money to buy temporary peace, while sowing deeper social risks.\n\nWas this 'protection' a genuine safeguard of their culture, or was it a numbing of their backwardness? Is continuing to struggle in a closed economic system and linger in pre-modern production relations truly 'respecting' them? The answer is clearly no. The backward clan system, the primitive way of life, is in essence an opposition to socialist modernization. This opposition not only shackles the thoughts of the local people, but also becomes an obstacle in the nation’s march toward communism.\n\nWith the deepening of the revolution, the issues in the southwestern mountainous areas have been thoroughly exposed. Some grassroots mass organizations, while advancing socialist reforms, have clashed fiercely with clan societies. Behind these clashes, there are both economic interests and deep ideological divides. The revolutionary masses are attempting to push forward the transformation of local economies, cultures, and lifestyles through organized means, while the leaders of the clan societies are attempting to resist all external modernizing reforms under the banner of 'traditional culture.' They loudly defend tradition, but in reality, they are maintaining their own vested interests.\n\nIf the revolution in Tibet in the last century was a magnificent chapter from slavery to modernity, then the issues in the southwestern mountainous areas are undoubtedly a continuation of the transition from clan societies to modernity. We must face this issue squarely: these conservative social structures must be completely dismantled; these backward production relations must be crushed by the revolutionary hammer. The red flag of socialist modernization cannot leave any blank spaces, and the sunshine of communism must illuminate every corner. Every person on this land, whether Han or ethnic minority, whether mountain resident or urban laborer, must not be left behind!\n\nCurrently, the task of the revolution is clear. We must use the dauntless spirit of the proletariat to penetrate the southwestern mountainous areas, organizing the masses to completely transform these backward regions from the ideological, economic, and cultural perspectives. First, through democratic decision-making and mass movements, we must uproot the privileges of clan leaders and allow the true working masses to take control of local affairs; second, we must introduce advanced production tools and modern production methods, using cooperatives and collective economic models to help the local people break free from the constraints of outdated productivity; third, we must strengthen ideological education, replacing primitive superstitions with a scientific worldview, and replacing feudal backward clan concepts with socialist beliefs.\n\nComrades, the road of revolution is never smooth. The social transformation in the southwestern mountainous areas is not just a shock to backward culture, but a comprehensive struggle against the old ideology. We must use the flames of revolution to ignite the modernization process in the southwestern region, liberating the people there from their past shackles and making them true members of the socialist family. Only when every person stands on modernized land can the red flag of revolution truly reach every corner of our homeland!"

PRC_MAO.77.t:0 "Purification"
PRC_MAO.77.d:0 "A few days ago, late at night, the lights in the laboratory building of a famous university were still brightly on. Although it was already after work hours, several exhausted graduate students remained seated at the lab benches, mechanically repeating their tasks. On the projection screen in the corner, several drafts of papers marked with a certain professor’s name were being revised in turn, and an assistant coldly threw out a remark, 'Submit it tomorrow morning, and don’t forget to get the name right.'\n\n'Name? Ha, his son’s name is always at the top.' A graduate student muttered under his breath, his face filled with dissatisfaction, 'His son probably doesn’t even know where the laboratory door is.'\n\nBefore the words had fully left his mouth, the senior student sitting opposite him pushed up her glasses and sighed, 'Shh, be careful, don’t let them hear you. Just bear with it, this happens all the time. His son is about to graduate, so the professor puts his name on the paper to help him. It’s nothing new. We’ve long gotten used to being the 'invisible ones' doing all the work.'\n\n'But why?' Another younger student slammed his pen on the table, his voice filled with anger that had been suppressed for a long time. 'We work ourselves to the bone every day, finishing projects, and they just talk their way into claiming it as their achievement, even using it to apply for funding. These academic tyrants hold the country’s money, but stuff it into their own pockets, then treat us as laborers. Isn’t that exploitation?!'\n\nA brief silence fell over the lab, followed by a wave of quiet complaints. Some began recalling how the professor boasted about 'his projects' at last week’s meeting, while others ground their teeth in anger, recounting how the professor used research funds for personal projects. Even more had something to say about the professor’s children: papers with their names on them, special admissions for further study, privileged channels, all of these had almost become the default rules of the circle.\n\n'I heard that the project funds from last month were 'optimized,' and the professor bought a new car.' Someone added coldly.\n\nBut despite the complaints, these young graduate students had no choice but to lower their heads in the face of reality. They knew that as long as these 'academic tyrants' held the reins of power, these issues would never disappear.\n\nHowever, the scales of justice finally tipped.\n\nToday, CCTV broadcasted a sensational piece of news—a professor from a certain university was arrested on the spot for embezzling research funds, falsifying papers, and abusing his power. The footage showed him, pale-faced, being escorted out of the university, while the once-submissive assistants broke into applause.\n\n'Have you heard?' A senior student in the lab said excitedly, 'It’s not just our school—across the country, they’re cleaning up academic corruption. These academic tyrants are finally in trouble!'\n\nAnother younger student smiled with a hint of schadenfreude, 'It’s about time! These people treat power like their family heirloom, turning academia into their private property. It’s disgusting.'\n\nMeanwhile, an open letter from student representatives widely circulated both on and off-campus, directly pointing out the flaws of the 'academic tyrant system' and calling on young people to bravely pursue true academic freedom. The letter gained widespread support, with many students posting slogans around campus: 'Break the chains of authority, return academic freedom!' 'The lab is no longer a playground for privilege!' This unprecedented atmosphere of resistance filled the campus with a spirit of innovation.\n\nAnd deeper changes were quietly unfolding. The educational reform resolution explicitly called for the abolition of the monopoly of academic authority, encouraging young people to break free from the shackles of traditional thinking. New regulations required that research projects implement open and transparent funding reviews, the authorship of project results be allocated according to actual contributions, and advisors could no longer directly supervise their own close relatives in research projects. More importantly, the new academic evaluation system completely eliminated blind worship of authority, encouraging young people to focus on innovation and practice, and truly advancing science and technology.\n\n'Academia is for everyone, not the inheritance of certain families!' The students’ slogan echoed across the campus.\n\nIn the following period, more and more young scholars stepped onto the stage that belonged to them. No longer needing to bow and scrape, no longer needing to pay the price for the so-called 'mentor halo,' they used their own intelligence and effort to gradually reshape academic fairness and freedom.\n\nThe laboratory of that day was no longer a stifling cage but had become a vibrant and hopeful space for creativity. A young researcher, holding the just-completed experimental data, raised his head confidently and said to his colleagues, 'From today on, our names will only appear in places that truly belong to us.'"

PRC_MAO.76.t:0 "A New Day"
PRC_MAO.76.d:0 "The morning sun shines through the brand-new electronic curtains, casting light on the smiling faces of middle school students. Today marks a fresh start for this middle school in a small town in Henan—on the first day of the new standard junior high school education, after the abolition of the high school entrance exam.\n\nGone are the rigid desks and chairs from the past, replaced by circular tables, each student equipped with a multifunctional learning screen. A dozen or so students sit in groups, chatting and looking at the class schedule displayed on their screens: Basic Programming, Automated Equipment Operation, Artistic Creation, Sex Education, and a mysterious class titled 'Future Career Experience.' The number of classes has decreased, homework is almost non-existent, but the proportion of labor and experiments has significantly increased. There’s a sense of excitement among the students.\n\n'Can we really take this apart?' A boy is fiddling with a mechanical arm, his face full of curiosity. The teacher, standing nearby, smiles gently. 'Of course you can, but remember to wear gloves and be careful not to pinch your hand.' The boy looks up in surprise. 'Teacher, you look pretty good when you smile.' Laughter erupts from the surrounding students, and the teacher’s face flushes. 'Stop joking and focus on the experiment!' \n\nIn another corner, a girl wearing a hand-made 'Lolita' style school uniform stands, wearing a medical eye mask, holding a model rifle that she must have borrowed from somewhere, striking an exaggerated pose as she calls out to her desk mate, 'Sasa! Let’s start our date!' Her desk mate rolls his eyes and takes the 'invitation card' she hands him, while a few students nearby laugh until they can’t stand up. 'Here we go again, who is she cosplaying today? Next second she’ll probably shout 'exile the world!' \n\nThe atmosphere at the school has changed, and the entire campus has transformed with it. The previously stern teachers no longer stand aloof; some even show a bit of shyness, as if adapting to the new teaching environment. A once strict physics teacher is now squatting beside a 3D printer, holding an unformed plastic model, patiently explaining the properties of materials to students. Another Chinese language teacher, who rarely interacted with students, has even approached them with a few poetry collections and begun discussing romanticism. 'Hey, this line '山有木兮木有枝'—can you guess why it makes people feel something inside?' Her tone is gentle, with a look of expectation in her eyes.\n\nThe laboratory is livelier than ever. The once cold and sterile chemistry lab is now filled with laughter and cheers. A boy is carefully placing a fully assembled drone model on the table. 'I really put it together; it’s definitely going to fly this time!' A classmate next to him teases, 'Don’t let it fly out the window. Last time your paper airplane got stuck in the ceiling.' Before the sentence is even finished, the drone gently lifts off, hovering steadily in midair. The entire lab erupts in applause and cheers.\n\nThe library has undergone a complete transformation, becoming a comprehensive space that integrates learning, gaming, and relaxation. Groups of students are immersed in scientific readings, discussing problems, while others challenge math mazes on game-based learning screens. Two normally quiet students are gathered together, flipping through a book on 'Warfare Technology in World History.' In the far corner, a girl gently offers a handmade bouquet to a boy sitting in front of the computer, whispering, 'For you, wishing your experiment is a success today.' The boy’s ears turn red, and he doesn’t dare lift his head.\n\nEverything feels so relaxed, so natural. Gone are the oppressive atmosphere and the heavy anxiety over grades. Students in the corridors run by laughing, discussing whether to try the new equipment in the automation classroom this afternoon. Teachers no longer wear stern expressions; instead, they sit at the library’s large table with students, chatting like friends about the future and dreams.\n\nThe day quickly passes, but this new beginning is deeply imprinted in everyone’s memory. The school is no longer a battlefield for exams, but a place full of creativity and freedom—a place where students rediscover their love for learning and life. The air is filled with the scent of hope, and in the eyes of these middle school students is a shining future."

PRC_MAO.75.d:0 "The news footage cuts to a simple living room, with a steaming teacup on the table and an old family portrait hanging on the wall. The smiles in the photo stand in stark contrast to the scene before them. The camera zooms in on a middle-aged couple sitting on the sofa. The wife is clutching a damp handkerchief, her eyes filled with a mixture of sadness and relief. The husband sits beside her, his gaze serious, but after a moment of questioning from the reporter, he finally speaks.\n\n'Our son... was a 2020 college entrance exam candidate.' He pauses, as if organizing his words, as if restraining the emotions welling up inside him. 'At that time, his grades were everything. The exam was his entire world. But how could we know that behind what seemed like a fair test, there was so much oppression and injustice? We thought that as long as he worked hard, he could go out and live a good life. But what was the reality?' \n\nThe wife lowers her head, sobbing uncontrollably. 'That year... the days leading up to the exam, he stayed up late every night under the desk lamp, reviewing, doing practice questions. I asked him if he was tired, and he always smiled and said, 'It's okay, Mom, I can hold on.' But I didn’t know how much pressure he was bearing behind that smile. He secretly saw a psychologist and took medication... Until one day, he left a note saying sorry, and then...' She covers her face, her shoulders shaking violently, tears sliding through her fingers.\n\nThe reporter's voice is soft but heavy, 'What happened after that?' \n\nThe husband continues, his voice low but filled with a certain determination. 'After that, we lived in regret, questioning ourselves, questioning the system. We thought the college entrance exam was the only way out, but we never thought about how many children’s lives were crushed by this way out. Later, we saw reports on the education reform on TV. The college entrance exam was abolished, and a recommendation system was reintroduced. We saw those kids no longer buried in a sea of questions, but had more time to work, to practice, to smile... Do you know? We saw them smile, and that smile looked just like our son’s smile when he was little.' \n\nThe wife looks up, her eyes still wet with tears, but now with a trace of relief. 'We finally understood, it wasn’t our child who was wrong, it was the system that made children treat scores as their lives. It was that era that made us value grades so much that we ignored our children’s feelings. We had been brainwashed into believing the exam decided everything... But it destroyed everything.' \n\nThe camera pans to the children playing and laughing on the playground, sunlight illuminating their faces. Every one of them is full of youthful vitality. The wife’s voice softly echoes, 'Now, seeing these children, I think my son would have liked this kind of life too. He should have had the chance to smile like them.' \n\nThe news footage fades to black, leaving only the tired but hopeful faces of the middle-aged couple frozen on the screen.

PRC_MAO.74.t:0 "The Trend of 'Internet Famous Literature'"
PRC_MAO.74.d:0 "As early as the years before the wrongs of the Gang of Four were rectified, a satirical form of creative writing quietly emerged on the internet—'Internet Famous Literature.' This literary style initially gained popularity in a few anonymous forums and subculture communities. It combined deconstruction with re-creation, often focusing on 'Cultural Revolution' figures like Wang Hongwen and Zhang Chunqiao, using exaggerated details and a mocking tone to both satirize the absurdity of the political purges of the time and re-imagine these historical figures. Wang Hongwen’s 'standard image with sunglasses' became the beginning of this cultural phenomenon, with the minimalist caption 'Very cool, no talking,' transforming him into a symbol of rebellion, both mysterious and tinged with tragic overtones. Later, exaggerated fictional details, such as 'solar-powered lighters' and 'getting twenty bottles of pickled vegetables in one go,' quickly swept the internet, becoming popular material for secondary creations.\n\nThe original intention of 'Internet Famous Literature' was to satirize absurd history, but over time, it gradually evolved beyond mere entertainment. As more people participated, many began to find deeper emotional resonance in it. Some felt a sense of regret for 'idealists,' while others, through deconstructive humor, began to re-examine the confused and misunderstood historical era. Particularly the diversification of Wang Hongwen’s image—from a serious revolutionary to the 'cute' 'Little Wang,' and then to the tragic hero-like 'loser'—led more young people to begin re-understanding the complexities of the Cultural Revolution through this cultural form.\n\nBut as history opened a new chapter and the wrongs of the Gang of Four were rectified, the complex history of the Cultural Revolution was gradually restored, and 'Internet Famous Literature' quickly moved from the margins of subculture into the public eye. Some began to worry whether this satirical deconstruction would cross the line of respect for revolutionary martyrs and whether it would become a cultural desecration. On the internet, debates over 'Internet Famous Literature' heated up, with some older revolutionary supporters even writing letters to the Ministry of Propaganda, questioning whether this 'mockery' of revolutionary heroes disrespects the martyrs. Young creators, however, argued that secondary creation was not meant to belittle but to use humor and satire to dismantle the stigmatization of historical figures and break through the distorted narratives.\n\nThe controversy continued for a while, until a government announcement was issued, bringing the matter to a close. The announcement made it clear that the state would not ban secondary creations based on Cultural Revolution history but instead encouraged people to use this form to deconstruct the smears and slanders spread by class enemies during the revolution. 'Internet Famous Literature' not only broke the narrative of stigmatization but, more importantly, it brought history from cold textbooks into the lives of the people, becoming a broad cultural memory through the combination of humor and authenticity. The last line of the announcement was deafening: 'We are no longer the country that was distorted and shackled, but a country truly liberated for the people.'\n\nWith the release of the announcement, the discussion surrounding 'Internet Famous Literature' subtly shifted. Some critics gradually put down their doubts and began to re-examine the potential of this creative form, while more people threw themselves into new creations. Consequently, Wang Hongwen’s 'sunglasses' image became even more popular in memes, and it even appeared on the annual trending list of certain social platforms. In a certain sense, 'Internet Famous Literature' has ceased to be just a form of mockery. It has become a re-examination of history in the new era, a bold embrace of truth, and a firm declaration of a broader, freer future."

PRC_MAO.73.t:0 "Joint Burial"
PRC_MAO.73.d:0 "In the afternoon at Futian Cemetery, the air is heavy with a suffocating atmosphere. The sunlight filters through the tall pine trees, casting light on the quiet land. It seems as though the dust of history has settled here, silent within this place. This is the sacred ground of revolution, where countless revolutionary martyrs rest, yet today, it will be different from any other day.\n\nAs the procession approaches the tombstone, the sound of horns suddenly breaks the silence, shattering the stillness. The honor guard of the People's Liberation Army marches in perfect unison, their steps strong and firm, their chests held high. In front of the procession, a golden box filled with ashes is carefully held—inside is the remains of Mao Zedong—who, at this moment, will be laid to rest beside a revolutionary figure who had long been ignored.\n\nThousands of citizens surround the square at the cemetery, their faces showing emotions they can barely conceal, emotions that surge like a tidal wave. Many of them had once worshipped that revolutionary leader, revered that monument that once stood at the peak of an era. Now, with the turning of history, they watch this great figure finally return to his rightful place, their hearts filled with complex emotions.\n\nAs the honor guard slowly approaches, Li Na stands at the front of the cemetery, her shoulders trembling slightly, her eyes already blurred with tears. Her gaze is fixed on the golden box, every step seeming to tear at her heart. Her mother, Jiang Qing, had once been distorted by history, branded a 'witch,' buried under the dust of the times, until her ashes could finally rest alongside Mao Zedong.\n\n'Salute to Comrade Jiang Qing!' \n\nA solemn shout pierces the air, almost freezing the atmosphere in its wake. The honor guard halts, and everyone shouts in unison, the voices filled with deep respect and a complex mix of emotions.\n\nLi Na nearly collapses in that instant. She falls to the ground, tears pouring out like a flood, her face a mask of uncontrollable grief, her hands clutching her clothes as if holding onto the last thread connecting her to her mother. Those years, she had witnessed her mother’s fall from the pinnacle, bearing all the criticism and accusations, until everything was covered by the sands of time, even her mother’s name almost erased. But today, history finally vindicates her mother, and this ceremony might be the last comfort she will ever receive.\n\n'Mom...' She whispers, her eyes tangled with pain and helplessness, forming an invisible web that tightly binds her heart. 'Finally, you can be with him.' The accumulated resentment and sorrow of those years find an outlet at this moment, though she knows it will not erase everything, but at least, for this moment, she can lay her mother’s soul to rest in her heart.\n\nThe surrounding crowd stands rigidly, their eyes filled with shock, confusion, and endless admiration. At this historic turning point, the once-revolutionary hero returns in another form, re-recognized. All of this happens after the Gang of Four is vindicated. That history, which was once tightly sealed, is finally opened. Mao Zedong's cremation and Jiang Qing's burial are like a slow but profound cleansing, gradually releasing the long-buried secrets of history.\n\nAs the urn is buried in the ground, the honor guard slowly retreats. Li Na still sits there, unable to hold herself together. Her eyes remain fixed on that spot, as if her mother’s soul is resting beneath the earth, quietly joining with Mao Zedong’s. She feels the storm of history has gradually calmed, and at last, she can lay down those unspeakable burdens.\n\nThe sky is a clear blue, the pines in the cemetery gently swaying. A light breeze blows, taking away the sorrow, yet leaving an eternal tranquility. The wheel of history halts here, and time seems to return to an ancient moment, where those names once erased by history are quietly revived. At this moment, Li Na finally finds a sense of reconciliation with her mother.\n\nIn this moment, history and the future begin to intertwine into an extraordinary picture."

In the conference room, the screen flickers with real-time intelligence from across the country, with red marks already covering most of the map. Only the North China region, that last untouched deep blue area, stands like an isolated island, fiercely resisting the surrounding chaos.\n\n'It’s all over.' A low but clear murmur breaks the silence, ringing like the sound of a heavy bell in everyone’s hearts. All eyes turn to the head of the intelligence department, his face pale, the report in his hands trembling slightly. 'The worst news has arrived—our rule is on the brink of collapse.'\n\n'What exactly is the situation?' A standing member asks, his voice hoarse, trying to maintain composure, though shock and fear are clear in his tone.\n\n'South of the Yangtze River, it’s completely out of control.' The report is passed silently, the slight rustling of paper more unsettling than any words. 'The port cities on the southeastern coast have been divided by multiple rebel forces—workers, students, religious extremists, each fighting their own battles, but all equally hostile to us. In the western regions, calls for minority autonomy can no longer be suppressed. Even our resource hubs have been seized by opposing forces in fierce clashes.'\n\n'What about South China?' Another high-ranking officer asks, his voice trembling.\n\n'The divided forces have reached some tacit understanding. The police and armed forces have lost their allegiance. Our cadres are either captured or have chosen to surrender.' The head of intelligence inhales deeply, trying to steady his voice. 'At the moment, we only hold North China, but the logistics system has been cut off, and shortages of supplies will soon trigger even greater problems.'\n\nThe room falls silent, only the red dots on the screen continue to flicker, like a silent disaster spreading deep into everyone’s nerves. A military officer stands up, slamming his hand on the table, seemingly trying to use force to dispel the despair. 'What about the army? Is there any possibility of stabilizing the situation through emergency deployments?' \n\n'Our remaining troops are only enough to barely maintain order in North China.' The chief of staff’s response is like a cold blade slicing through the air. 'And morale has plummeted. The weapons captured by the rebel army are more than we anticipated, and the worst part is that they seem to have external support.'\n\n'External support?' Someone raises their head sharply, disbelief evident in their voice.\n\n'Yes, our intercepted intelligence shows that some international NGOs are covertly providing supplies and intelligence support.' The chief of staff’s tone is calm, but it feels like a plunge into an icy abyss.\n\nSome curse softly in the corner, others remain silent. The atmosphere is as heavy as a massive stone pressing down on everyone’s chest, suffocating them. After a long pause, Xi Jinping slowly speaks, his voice hoarse and weary: 'So, what now? Should we continue to hold on, or...'\n\nHe doesn’t finish the sentence, but the unfinished words send the room into even deeper silence. Admitting defeat has never been considered an option in this system. But continuing to 'gamble' means putting all the chips into a bet destined to be filled with despair.\n\nEveryone lowers their heads, not wanting to be the first to speak. The sound of the wind outside grows harsher, as if singing a dirge for this land of ruin."

The atmosphere is stifling, each person tense, fearing that their emotions might give away any signs of unrest. On the screen, the latest intelligence has just been displayed, and several high-ranking officials exchange glances, but no one speaks first.\n\n'Finally, they’ve started turning on each other.' Finally, a deputy minister from the Ministry of State Security breaks the silence, pointing to the cities marked in red on the screen, 'The so-called 'democratic revolutionary forces' made up of workers and students have clashed directly with the members of the cult group Falun Gong in the suburbs. According to intelligence, there are casualties on both sides, and the conflict seems to be escalating.'\n\nThese words spark a brief, hidden sense of relief among the room. Some officials can’t help but smile, though these smiles are brief and filled with complex meanings. 'Let them fight,' one senior standing member slowly says, with a barely noticeable lightness in his tone, 'We’d rather they exhaust themselves, the more intense, the better. This is one of the few good news we’ve had.'\n\nThen a military adviser stands up, pointing to the map, 'From a geographical standpoint, the conflict is happening along key supply lines, but it doesn’t have much impact on us. They’re holding each other back, which gives us the chance to stabilize other more important regions. As for the Falun Gong leaders, their activities appear religious, but they’re actually chaotic. As for the workers and students, they lack unified leadership, and their internal conflicts are already showing. This conflict may serve as a delayed buffer for us.'\n\nSomeone chimes in: 'However, once Falun Gong gets involved, we need to keep up with our propaganda. Continue to steer public opinion, labeling the rebellion as extremism and superstitious activities. This way, the grassroots masses will be more inclined to support the government.'\n\nLow murmurs of agreement echo in the room, and a fleeting sense of pleasure spreads across everyone’s face, but it is soon swallowed by deeper shadows. An intelligence officer shakes his head. 'However, this is not a long-term solution. No matter how much they fight among themselves, they’ll eventually come after us. We can’t expect internal conflict to resolve the situation.'\n\nOnce again, the room falls silent. The satellite images of the conflict zones continue to flash on the screen. Burning vehicles, broken buildings, shadows of people running and fighting. This is a chaotic battle with no clear victor, yet each side loses more.\n\n'But at least,' the deputy minister says softly, almost to comfort himself, 'we still have a little time.'\n\nNo one refutes him, no one responds. They all know that although this conflict brings a temporary respite, it cannot hide the deeper crisis. As the chaos deepens, time quietly slips away, and the real storm seems to be approaching."

The Shandong region stands out with its bright red marking, which represents not only the rebellion but also a more complex issue arising from the chaos—the resurgence of cult groups.\n\n'Falun Gong is back.' The intelligence minister's face is grim, and the report in his hands emanates a heavy atmosphere. 'It's not just Falun Gong, but several other various cult groups as well. They are particularly active in Shandong, rapidly expanding their influence in the current chaos, even openly promoting anti-government rhetoric and inciting public emotions.'\n\n'What’s the specific situation?' A standing committee member lowers his voice, but his anger and unease are still apparent.\n\n'On the surface, these groups are conducting religious activities, but in reality, they disguise themselves as “healing and saving people,” spreading anti-government rumors and even organizing militia-like armed forces.' The minister flips through the report in his hands, pointing to a marked area. 'Near Jinan, we discovered an underground meeting point. They claim it is “the salvation of the apocalypse” and have attracted large numbers of people who are emotionally unstable due to unemployment and hunger.'\n\n'What’s worse,' he pauses, scanning the room, 'these groups seem to have formed some loose alliances, using social media and underground channels to communicate. What they are spreading is not religious faith, but a “belief” filled with intense dissatisfaction with the current situation.'\n\n'Those spreading rumors and panic must be dealt with.' A military representative says coldly, slamming his fist on the table, shaking the teacups. 'Otherwise, the situation will only worsen!'\n\n'The problem is,' the chief of staff responds with a hint of fatigue, 'our forces are already spread out across various regions dealing with the rebellion. The armed police and special forces in Shandong are almost all tied up with the riots in Jinan and Qingdao. How much manpower can we spare to deal with these cults?'"

The crowd surges toward the police headquarters in the city center. On the square, the firelight reflects off their faces, every pair of eyes filled with resentment and defiance.\n\nInside the police station, Director Liu Anguo sits in his office, nervously rubbing his hands. Sweat beads on his forehead, his back soaked with cold sweat. He looks around, seeing his subordinates, who are usually obedient to orders, now bowing their heads in silence, too afraid to make eye contact with him.\n\n'They're coming!' A young policeman rushes in from the monitoring room, his voice trembling, 'Director, there are too many of them... we... we can’t stop them!' \n\nLiu Anguo suddenly stands up, knocking over the teacup on his desk. The sound of breaking glass is jarring in the quiet office. He growls, 'You are police officers! Pick up your weapons! Maintain order!'\n\nThe young policeman looks up, fear and hesitation in his eyes. 'Director, those people outside aren’t rioters… they are our parents, our neighbors… Can we really open fire on them?'\n\nLiu Anguo freezes, his throat moving up and down, but he cannot speak. Seconds later, the shouting outside becomes deafening, the sound of the police station’s doors being pounded echoes like war drums. The surveillance screen shows the crowd has blocked the entire street, with even the nearest police cars overturned.\n\n'Open the door!' A voice screams, filled with tearing anger. 'Hand over those who have harmed us!' \n\nLiu Anguo trembles slightly. He realizes that today, he may have nowhere to run.\n\nSeveral mid-level police officers exchange glances, and finally, someone speaks. 'Director, we can’t hold them off any longer. There’s no more reinforcements, and the officers inside... they’re not willing to shed more blood.'\n\nJust then, a loud crash is heard outside, and the iron door is smashed open. The crowd floods into the police station like a tidal wave, holding various tools in their hands. Some wave iron rods, others light torches. Faced with the angry crowd storming in, the police retreat to the walls, silently lowering their shields and batons.\n\n'Liu Anguo, you dog of an official, come out!' A middle-aged man in the crowd yells, his voice hoarse yet deafening, as if releasing years of pent-up resentment.\n\nLiu Anguo hides in his office, gripping the edge of his desk with both hands. He can hear the footsteps of the crowd drawing closer, his heart pounding in his chest. The faces of those he had neglected, exploited, and even persecuted over the years flash before his eyes, each one like a knife stabbing into his heart.\n\nThe door is suddenly kicked open, and several young men rush in, their eyes burning with vengeful fury. They drag Liu Anguo from his chair and pull him to the stairs of the lobby. By now, the entire police station has been overtaken by the people, and the police stand in the corners, expressionless, watching everything unfold, no one stepping forward to intervene.\n\n'Kneel!' A masked person commands harshly.\n\nLiu Anguo falls to the ground, his lips trembling, finally breaking down and shouting, 'I... I was just following orders! The people you're looking for aren't me!' \n\nLaughter erupts from the crowd, followed by someone angrily shouting, 'Orders? Who told you to embezzle emergency funds? Who treated our lives like bargaining chips? Today, either you die, or we live!' \n\nThe anger in the crowd turns into unrestrained violence. Liu Anguo struggles to shout a few words, but his voice is drowned out by the swinging fists and rods. The chaotic images in the lobby are all recorded by the surveillance cameras on the walls, uploaded to the internet, and quickly spread across the country.\n\nMeanwhile, similar scenes are playing out across the country. Enraged citizens storm government buildings and police stations, hunting down those once in power. The police are either indifferent or turn and walk away, as if they’ve already become helpless against the tide of fury.\n\nThe chaos is spreading like wildfire, and every drop of blood and every shout seems to be hastening the arrival of a collapse."

A rusted truck is parked outside the militia headquarters, with several militia members in worn camouflage uniforms standing at the door, their faces a mixture of unreadable emotions.\n\n'Are we really going to do this?' A young militia member whispers, his palms turning white as beads of sweat glisten in the dim light.\n\n'What else can we do?' The veteran standing beside him responds in a low voice. 'If you don’t do it, they’ll find someone else. This situation has to be faced sooner or later.'\n\nInside, the militia captain leans his hands on the table, the map in front of him crumpled. Across from him, the worker representative has sharp eyes, and his tone is unwavering. 'We’re not here to use force against you. All we want is fairness, a chance to survive. And what about you? How long will you keep serving those who only know how to exploit us?'\n\nThe captain is silent for a moment, as though weighing his options or perhaps struggling. He slowly stands straight, his gaze sweeping over the people in the room. 'The weapons are in the warehouse, but I warn you—take them and don’t regret it. Once you take this step, there’s no turning back.'\n\nThe worker representative smiles, his eyes resolute. 'There’s no turning back. Now, it’s time to move forward.'\n\nHalf an hour later, the warehouse doors of the militia headquarters are quietly opened, and boxes of guns and ammunition are loaded onto the truck. The people helping with the loading are not just militia members but also several young men holding iron rods, their school uniforms so dirty they are barely recognizable. They exchange excited glances under the light.\n\nThe truck leaves the headquarters and drives along the dilapidated dirt roads on the outskirts of town toward a secret meeting point. The atmosphere in the truck is heavy, and the students at the back of the truck hold the rifles they’ve been given, their faces filled with a mix of curiosity and unease. They whisper to each other, as if afraid to wake the sleeping night.\n\n'Are we really going to do it?' A boy with thick glasses asks softly.\n\n'We’ve come this far, what’s there to be afraid of?' Another worker-looking person answers, his hand tightening around the rifle’s stock.\n\nA few hours later, the rebel forces gather at a small square near the factory, with guns distributed to each member. The weapons in their hands are no longer farm tools and homemade iron rods, but real firepower. One person in the crowd raises a handmade red flag, featuring a hammer and gear symbol, representing the anger of the working class.\n\nHowever, the spread of chaos is just beginning. A student who has arrived from another region stands in the crowd, holding a megaphone and shouting to those around him. 'The militia in the county town is no longer loyal to the oppressors! They stand with us! Brothers and sisters, we are not alone!' \n\nHis voice cuts through the night, reaching every awakened soul in the town. Small fires start in the alleys, symbolizing the seeds of unrest beginning to take root. Meanwhile, the square in front of the county government building is eerily silent, with several officials holding walkie-talkies, hastily dialing numbers, but no one answers.\n\nOn the other side of the square, several panicked police officers run to vehicles parked nearby, trying to flee. They mutter words like 'rescue' and 'orders from above,' but no one listens anymore.\n\nUnder the night sky in the county town, the fires light up half the sky, and the rifle barrels point coldly at the uncertainty of the future. Everyone knows that the cracks in the order can no longer be patched, and the storm of chaos is beginning to spread from this land."

Outside the windows, the faint flicker of city neon lights contrasts with the swirling vortex of power and crisis inside.\n\nAround the conference table, everyone is pale, their furrowed brows and sunken eyes revealing the exhaustion of sleepless nights. The air is thick with the scent of tea, yet it cannot mask the pervasive tension. On the central screen, a military report quietly lingers: The 82nd Group Army refuses to carry out the suppression orders.\n\n'This is not the aftermath of the Henan factory incident.' An older officer breaks the silence first, his voice hoarse but stern. 'It’s that the morale of the army has faltered. All political efforts to stabilize the situation have failed, and the soldiers' resistance to the suppression mission is becoming more apparent. The 82nd Group Army is just the first to disobey. There will likely be more.'\n\n'More?' A young political officer can't help but speak, panic and unease seeping into his voice. 'The troops we’ve mobilized are already scarce. At this rate, are we going to rely on the militia to control the situation?' \n\n'Control the situation?' Another older officer sneers, tapping the table. 'Even the frontline troops are wavering. What do you expect those hastily assembled militias to do? Watch?' \n\nThe room falls into silence again. Everyone's eyes unconsciously fall upon the silent General Secretary in the seat of honor. He lifts his head, his gaze sweeping over each person present, as if searching for an answer or weighing some heavy bet.\n\n'We need to make a decision,' his voice is low but filled with an undeniable authority. 'The domestic situation is deteriorating. The flames of unrest have spread from north to south. If the defiance of the 82nd Group Army spreads further, we will face unprecedented challenges.'\n\n'So what are our options?' A long-time official in charge of Taiwan affairs grits his teeth and asks. 'Abandon the Taiwan operation and focus all efforts on suppressing domestic unrest?' \n\n'Abandon?' Another person immediately retorts, his voice mixed with anger and resentment. 'If we give up, the consequences are unimaginable! Taiwan will declare complete independence, and all sacrifices will be in vain! It will be a disaster for the nation's credibility.' \n\n'But what if we continue gambling?' A more rational voice interjects. 'Right now, the domestic economy is on the brink of collapse, public morale is in disarray, the army's resolve is wavering, the police force is overstretched, and even external sanctions are increasing. Have we thought about the outcome if we lose even our last card?' \n\nThe General Secretary takes a deep breath, his gaze cold and sharp. 'There is one last possibility—if we succeed in the Taiwan operation, if the red flag flies over Taipei, we might be able to rekindle the faith of the nation.' \n\n'But what if we fail?' A senior official sitting in the corner speaks, his voice like cold water splashing on a hot iron plate. 'Failure will not just be a military defeat; it will be a political, economic, and ideological catastrophe. We will lose everything.' \n\nA long silence. The ticking of the clock seems to pierce the air.\n\n'We don’t have much time left,' the General Secretary stands up, his eyes cutting through everyone like a knife.\n\nThe lights in the room suddenly seem blinding, and everyone’s shadows stretch long. Outside, the Beijing night sky is dark, like a bottomless well, faintly echoing the distant restlessness."

The file in his hand is wrinkled, each page filled with hastily written notes. 'Videos and photos are spreading through various channels, and the national response is beyond our expectations.'\n\n'What exactly do you mean by beyond expectations?' A senior official at one end of the table speaks, his tone harsh, his tired eyes lifting from the thick file.\n\n'There have been chain reactions in many places—demonstrations and strikes. Guangzhou, Shanghai, Chongqing, Xi’an... Even industrial districts in second-tier cities are seeing large-scale protests,' the official pauses, wiping sweat from his brow. 'The speed of police mobilization is completely unable to keep up with the development of the situation.'\n\nThe room falls into a brief silence. It seems everyone is waiting for someone to break the deadlock, but no one wants to take the responsibility.\n\n'How big is the impact of the Henan incident?' A young officer sitting in the corner asks quietly.\n\n'How big?' Another senior official sneers, throwing a stack of the latest reports onto the table. 'Look for yourself. It’s not just the workers, but students, farmers, liberals, even some veterans. Voices from all social classes are intertwined, forming an incredible chain reaction. Our police force? In many places, they can't even maintain basic order!' \n\n'What about the black-clad people?' Another person interjects, his tone tinged with urgency.\n\n'Those people are just mercenaries paid to act; they were always a temporary measure,' the person answering speaks quietly, but his words cut like a knife. 'Once the workers organize, these thugs can’t stop them. The factory battle in Henan is the best example—weren’t those black-clad people scattered like rats?' \n\nA tea cup is suddenly smashed onto the table, making a sharp noise. A middle-aged official's face is flushed, clearly enraged by the suppressed anger. 'Enough! The focus now is not on blaming anyone, but deciding what to do next! We can't let the situation continue like this!' \n\n'Use the army.' The chief spokesperson, who has been silent for a long time, finally speaks. His voice is low and slow, but it lands like a heavy stone thrown into calm waters, provoking a reaction from everyone.\n\n'The army?' Someone stands up angrily. 'This is an internal matter! If the army intervenes, the consequences could be worse than now! This is shaking the foundation!' \n\n'Foundation? What foundation do we have now? It’s a siege on all sides, uncontrollable chaos, and a large-scale rebellion that could break out at any moment!' The spokesperson retorts coldly, his gaze as sharp as a knife.\n\nThe room falls into silence again. The clock on the wall ticks dully, as if counting down to an inevitable moment.\n\n'Wait,' someone finally breaks the silence with a low voice. 'Let’s observe for a few more days and see if the situation calms down on its own. Deploying the army requires extreme caution.' \n\n'Few days?

PRC_MAO.65.d:0 "As night falls, the noise and restlessness of the factory continue to fill the air. However, inside this large factory in Henan, the scene is no longer one of normal operation. Lights flicker through broken windows, machines have stopped, tools and makeshift signs are scattered across the ground. An uncontrollable anger is quietly burning, until it becomes fierce.\n\nAt the factory gate, young workers and migrant workers no longer try to hide their anger. They wave iron rods and flags, shouting loud slogans. A team of veterans stands at the front, silent but resolute. Their eyes are like knives, sharp and direct towards the distant defense line. Behind them are young left-wing students and liberal intellectuals who have come after hearing the news, holding loudspeakers and brimming with ideals and passion. The latest intelligence from the labor communication network spreads like wildfire among the workers, making everything seem even more uncontrollable.\n\n'Here they come!' A voice breaks the silence of the night. In the distance, the flashing red and blue lights of a police car grow louder, and the blaring siren pierces the air. Moments later, a fully equipped squad of police rushes to the outer perimeter of the factory. However, what greets them is not the expected surrender, but a confrontation without retreat.\n\nThe young workers immediately meet them, swinging hammers and wooden sticks. The migrant workers in the back knock over the makeshift steel plates that served as barriers. The veterans follow quickly, moving nimbly, working in coordination to quickly set up a temporary defense line using the factory's modified equipment. The police try to advance with shields but are forced back by the unity and precision of the workers' strikes. A sharp scream is heard as a brick hits one of the riot helmets, and the cracked fragments cause even more chaos.\n\nHowever, the situation becomes even tenser with the arrival of the black-clad men. These hired thugs, dressed in identical black clothing, shout vulgar threats. Their appearance seems to give the police a brief respite. But when the black-clad men truly enter the factory, they realize that they are not facing a ragtag group of rebels.\n\nA young student rushes to the front and shouts, 'They are just cowards hired to fight for money! Comrades, we have no way out!' At that moment, the emotions of the crowd reach a boiling point. The black-clad men attempt to break through the crowd but are repelled by the organized resistance. The sound of iron pipes swinging fills the air, and when one black-clad man stumbles out of the factory gate, shouting 'Damn, these people are crazy,' it signals their complete defeat.\n\nMoments later, the police begin to waver. Their leader stands at the back of the squad, loudly ordering them not to retreat, but the young police officers, seeing the chaos in the front lines, hesitantly take a step back, then another.\n\nEventually, only wreckage remains in the factory. The veterans regroup, the workers raise their fists in the air, and cheers echo through the night. The students quickly use their phones to record everything, while the liberals prepare the press releases they plan to send to the international community.\n\nIn the midst of this chaos, no one knows what tomorrow will bring. But tonight, they know they stand at a key point in history. The order of the oppressors is starting to shake, and the voice of the workers finally rings out in the night sky."

Accompanied by screams and rising smoke, a bus, like a runaway beast, barrels through a crowded intersection, bringing a shocking disaster.\n\nThe incident takes place in a bustling commercial district of a medium-sized city in inland China. The bus, out of control, mounts the sidewalk, knocks down pedestrians, crashes into several parked cars, and only comes to a halt when it crashes into the glass curtain wall of a shopping mall. The scene is too horrific to look at, with scattered wreckage and people screaming in the chaos. Ambulance sirens quickly fill the air across the city.\n\nPost-incident statistics show that over eighty people, including passengers, tragically lost their lives, and more were injured. At first, people thought it was just a regular traffic accident, but after police investigation, an unbelievable truth was revealed.\n\nThe driver of the bus was a nearly fifty-year-old ordinary bus driver. According to the initial police investigation, this driver had been living in dire circumstances due to months of unpaid wages. He had repeatedly complained to the company and local labor arbitration agencies, but his issues remained unresolved. With an elderly mother at home who needed medical treatment, his helplessness gradually turned into despair, and despair eventually morphed into an explosive rage.\n\nOn the day of the incident, he left a chilling farewell message on his social media: 'Unpaid wages, squeezing every last drop of blood. Since no one will listen to me, let everyone hear me now.' \n\nThis horrific event sent shockwaves across the country. Discussions about this tragedy quickly reached the top of social media. Some expressed anger for the innocent victims, while others sympathized with the driver’s plight. More people began to sense a dangerous omen in this event—were the accumulated social problems, the growing individual grievances, reaching a point of no return?\n\nHowever, the government’s official statement seemed calm and mechanical. They labeled the incident as 'extreme individual behavior' and called on the public to 'remain calm, rational, and not to believe in rumors.' Meanwhile, local labor inspection departments were instructed to investigate the wage arrears issue immediately, and several officials in charge of the city’s bus management were 'temporarily suspended for investigation.'\n\nThough the government tried to calm the situation, the atmosphere in the city and across the country grew increasingly tense. In some areas, workers began to express their dissatisfaction with unpaid wages, and comment sections on social media slowly turned into outlets for emotional venting.\n\nA netizen wrote: 'Will this happen again?' \n\nMaybe this is just the tip of the iceberg, or perhaps it's the beginning of a deeper crisis. But whatever the case, the tragic events on that blood-red evening on the bus have become an indelible shadow in the hearts of the people."

Although the haze outside remains thick, the people inside have managed to relax a little.\n\nRecent reports indicate that large-scale domestic riots seem to be decreasing. The data charts are clear: the scale of protests has shrunk, the number of gathering points has plummeted, and once-vibrant online protests have gradually quieted down.\n\n'It seems that our strategy is working,' a senior official in a gray suit murmurs, his finger lightly tapping on a document on the table.\n\nThe document in question details the activities of the 'black-clad men.' These individuals are discreet yet swift in their actions. Their task is simple and direct: using force and intimidation, they swiftly suppress any potential dissent. Their existence is not known to the public, but in many key areas, their effect is obvious.\n\n'We’ve bought ourselves some breathing room,' a security department leader speaks with a tone of satisfaction. 'They’ve effectively deterred organized protesters, especially in several northern cities. Although there has been some public outcry, overall, the result is positive.'\n\n'Is the 'outcry' referring to the BBC reports?' another person interjects, his tone tinged with disdain.\n\n'Yes, but we can handle it. We've already denied it, haven’t we?' A senior official from the propaganda department chuckles softly before flipping through his folder. 'The public’s attention can be redirected. Just add some more entertainment-focused content, and people will focus on something else.'\n\nLow murmurs of discussion spread around the table. Everyone understands that this temporary stability doesn’t mean the underlying problem is solved. Social dissatisfaction hasn’t disappeared; it’s just been suppressed for now. Those who’ve been intimidated may have chosen silence, but more observers are gathering strength, waiting for the next opportunity to erupt.\n\n'But remember,' Wang Huning taps the table, 'we cannot rely entirely on these black-clad men. They are just tools, not a long-term solution. The root of the problem still requires systematic policy adjustments—or at least, we must make people believe we are trying to adjust.'\n\nEveryone nods, but no one speaks further. They know that such remarks are more of a statement than a commitment to action.\n\nFinally, the meeting ends, and everyone disperses. Through the window, the city’s lights continue to shine brightly, but behind that brilliance, countless hidden undercurrents stir. Somewhere in the shadows of the city, those black-clad men are perhaps silently completing their next task."

The news spread quickly through the streets and alleys of the city.\n\nWitnesses’ accounts are conflicting. A few days ago, a group of black-clad, masked men appeared in the area where Li Ran often frequented. They were dressed in matching black coats, wearing hoods and face masks, carrying iron rods and wooden sticks. Their movements were stealthy but oppressive. Some said they specifically targeted people expressing dissatisfaction with the status quo; others said they not only threatened but also directly used violence.\n\nAnd this time, Li Ran became the victim.\n\nHis body was found in an unmonitored alley, multiple bruises covering his body, clearly having been beaten. However, the perpetrators left no trace, only bloodstains on the street and a spreading fear.\n\nMeanwhile, a BBC report from the UK thrust the incident into the international spotlight. The report compared these black-clad, masked men to extreme groups from the previous century, such as the 'Free Legion' and 'Stormtroopers,' calling them 'a new generation of force-based intimidation machines.' It also suggested a subtle connection between their actions and China’s internal political tensions.\n\n'The appearance of such masked groups marks the resurgence of a societal pathology. They seem to be trying to replace dialogue with fear,' the BBC commentator summarized in the program.\n\nThe Chinese government quickly issued a statement, denying any connection with the black-clad men.\n\n'These actions are not supported by the government. We believe this is just a spontaneous patriotic act by the people, perhaps a bit extreme, but we must understand their patriotic feelings and not suppress this enthusiasm,' the spokesperson's statement was vague and frustrating.\n\nOnce this statement was issued, it only sparked more questions and dissatisfaction. The discussion on social media exploded:\n\n'Spontaneous? Is it really spontaneous?' \n\n'Patriotic? Is hitting people with iron rods patriotic?' \n\nOther voices defended the government: 'The country is at a critical point. We must unite. Some people are just too sentimental!'\n\nLi Ran’s friends were angry but powerless. A young man, familiar with him, stood on the street, looking at the posters on the wall. Suddenly, the red color seemed to burn his eyes.\n\n'He was just an ordinary person, he just wanted to speak the truth.' The words turned in his throat, but he swallowed them.\n\nLi Ran’s death became a symbol. He had once been a passionate young man, trying to express his awakening through graffiti and blank paper. Now, his blood reminded everyone—at this time, the cost of awakening could be one’s life.\n\nAnd in the shadow of the street corner, the black-clad men’s silhouettes continued to move. They slipped through the crowd, unseen, becoming an inescapable nightmare.\n\nWho are they? Why have they appeared?\n\nThe answer did not emerge; only fear continued to spread. People began whispering in the night, speculating whether these black-clad men were organized, whether they were directed by someone, or if they were simply ghosts in the chaos. However, regardless of the truth, Li Ran’s death had left an indelible question mark on the country’s history."

The details of the case were shocking—the rebellion was not simply about workers’ rights, but was driven by an 'overseas force,' and all the clues pointed to a once-forgotten name—Han Dongfang.\n\n'Who is Han Dongfang?' Young people were quick to ask in the comments section.\n\n'You might not remember, but our parents might.' A popular comment quickly received thousands of likes.\n\nThirty years later, this name seemed to be dusted off from the pages of history and placed back under the spotlight. Han Dongfang, once a leader of student movements and now the head of China Labor Communications, had long since faded from public view. But for some, the name had never truly disappeared. For the older generation of revolutionaries, he was a traitor of the times; for many workers, he was a distant symbol, the defiant voice who dared to confront power and speak for the oppressed.\n\nThe police report was cautious and vague, stating that a large cache of documents, communication records, and financial transactions related to workers’ organizations had been seized at a secret location. These documents showed that the rebellion had been carefully planned, and Han Dongfang's name appeared prominently in all the key documents. Most shocking of all, some anonymous sources revealed that these materials showed his connections to several international workers' organizations. The authorities quickly labeled the incident as 'severe disruption of social stability, collusion with foreign anti-China forces.'\n\nOnce the news broke, public opinion quickly divided. Some condemned it as another deliberate fabrication targeting 'dissidents,' while others sneered, 'After thirty years, he’s still the same restless Han Dongfang.' \n\nMeanwhile, overseas media quickly followed up. A few blurry black-and-white photos resurfaced: a young Han Dongfang in the 1980s, waving a banner on the streets, sharply contrasting with the image now described as 'the mastermind.' Overseas workers' organizations issued statements denying direct contact with Han Dongfang but openly sympathized with and supported him.\n\n'Han Dongfang, this name is a symbol of hope. He did not incite rebellion; he was simply practicing the most basic human rights—the right for workers to have a voice,' a statement from an overseas workers' alliance sparked heated discussion online.\n\nHowever, the domestic response was completely different. The details in the police report were amplified, and the 'evidence' against Han Dongfang was spread in various ways. Official media commentators openly stated, 'After thirty years, Han Dongfang has not changed. He is still the one who tries to use chaos to undermine national stability.' \n\nThe shock of the case not only stemmed from Han Dongfang’s name returning to the public eye but also because it revealed a more complex reality: workers' issues, labor-capital contradictions, and international perspectives, issues seemingly far removed from the daily lives of ordinary people, were once again intertwined into an unavoidable network.\n\nIn a corner, the labor groups quietly discussed: 'Is the Han Dongfang case real or fabricated?' And for many ordinary citizens, their concern was whether this case would lead to even more turmoil.\n\nOn the dimly lit street, a middle-aged worker looked down at his phone, the screen showing a photo of Han Dongfang when he was young. A complex emotion passed through his eyes, eventually turning into a sigh, 'Thirty years, the times have changed, but we are still the same.'"

But soon, a familiar voice emerges, calm yet slightly aged, carrying a bit of rural flavor, yet unmistakably powerful. There’s no doubt, this is Mao Yuanxin’s voice.\n\n'Everyone, don’t rush, speak slowly, and sit down first.' The sound of chairs moving and a few light laughs can be heard in the recording. 'We are guests here, but while drinking tea, don’t forget why we’ve gathered today.'\n\nAfter a brief silence, his voice sounds again, with a reassuring confidence: 'You young people, passion is good, but remember, true strength comes from arming your mind with theory. Don’t just think about shouting slogans in the streets; first, make sure you understand what you are actually shouting about.'\n\nThe listeners can almost picture a simple elder sitting in a modest study, perhaps with a few books and a teapot on the table. He continues: 'I’m telling you, a big change might be coming soon. This is not alarmist talk, nor is this old man just rambling. The wheel of history, sooner or later, will not stop. But remember, where that wheel heads is not something your hot blood alone can decide. It requires you to study, to understand, and to grasp every opportunity.'\n\n'Wait for the right moment, don’t act rashly.' His tone becomes even calmer. 'How many times in history has hasty action led to greater defeat? Trust the people, believe that they will awaken in their suffering, and believe in yourselves, that you can stand up when they wake up. But before standing up, make sure you have something real. You can’t just rely on shouting “down with...” and expect to accomplish something.'\n\nThere is a pause in the recording. Someone quietly interrupts: 'What should we do now?'\n\nMao Yuanxin chuckles, his voice carrying a hint of playful sarcasm: 'What else can we do? Read, write, and organize discussions when there’s a chance. Don’t let them think you’re headless chickens, bumping around aimlessly. We need to let them see that you have direction, that you have reason, and that you are serving the people.'\n\nAt the end of the recording, his voice becomes softer, yet more powerful: 'Remember, victory is not won by shouting; it’s achieved step by step. Don’t rush now, the good times are still ahead.'\n\nThe recording ends, but the storm has only just begun. This recording spreads rapidly across social media, sparking endless debate. Supporters call it 'the teachings of an old revolutionary,' 'the dawn of a new hope.' Opponents label it as 'alarmist talk,' and some even call it 'malicious fabrication.'\n\nThe government quickly responds, dismissing the recording as 'AI-generated speech' and warns the public not to believe or spread rumors. However, the tone and choice of words in Mao Yuanxin’s voice make it hard to ignore. The simple and accessible expressions, the reasoned analysis, don’t seem like something fabricated. The voices of doubt and support intertwine, making this recording even more elusive.\n\n'Regardless of its truth, this recording really made me rethink a lot,' someone comments online. Meanwhile, more discussions quietly unfold offline.\n\nIn a dimly lit rented room, a young man takes off his headphones and silently saves the recording to his hard drive. He looks up, staring at the portraits of Marx and Lenin on the wall. A subtle sense of power seems to awaken inside him.\n\n'Wait for the right moment...' he murmurs, his eyes flickering with a complex light."

This decision might delay the Party’s internal fragmentation but also makes the central authority seem increasingly fragile."

PRC_quell_the_protests_1_desc: "Our flag still flies high, but the wave of protests is sweeping across the country. After the victory in the Taiwan Strait war, the consequences of economic collapse are finally surfacing: soaring unemployment, continued material shortages, and worsening economic turbulence from foreign capital withdrawals. The protesters on the streets are not only students long dissatisfied with the Party, but also veterans who paid the price for the war, bankrupt entrepreneurs, and ordinary citizens who have lost their jobs.\n\nTheir slogans have shifted from dissatisfaction with the war to a complete disillusionment with the Party’s policies. The protests have escalated from peaceful gatherings to large-scale confrontations. Although the police have tried to curb the situation, the increasingly complex circumstances make it difficult for them to maintain control. The Party’s internal stance remains divided: should they suppress with an iron fist or try to ease the public discontent through compromise? Either way, time is no longer on our side."

china.40.d: "Tibet has always been a controversial topic in China’s geopolitical landscape. Since its reintegration into the People’s Republic of China in 1951, Tibet has been plagued by separatist forces and Tibetan exile independence groups. However, in the past 70 years, the situation has never been as turbulent as it is now. The social crisis caused by the Taiwan Strait war has paralyzed local grassroots administrative institutions, with many previously suppressed separatists resuming their activities. The local people’s growing fear of the increasingly unstable situation has accelerated the crisis. The Chinese government recently declared a state of emergency in parts of Tibet, imposing martial law. The international community has cast a concerned and worried eye on this silent plateau."
china.149.d: "In a sealed conference room in Zhongnanhai, Xi Jinping is holding a meeting with his closest aides. It was in this room that Xi gave the order to execute the Taiwan Strait operation.\n\n'Our country is diplomatically isolated, Comrade Chairman,' the Minister of Foreign Affairs said bitterly. 'The war has severely damaged our international image, and our performance during the war has made us more despised. Many ambassadors have already submitted their resignations.'\n\n'The military is also demoralized, Comrade Chairman,' the Vice Chairman of the Military Commission said with a mournful face, lacking the confidence from before the war. 'Several units nearly mutinied, and Party political commissars and commanders are blaming each other.'\n\nThe Director of the General Office stood up to report, with an expression of anger but helplessness: 'The most worrying situation is within the Party: grassroots Party members have borne much of the burden of maintaining stability and have voiced a lot of grievances. At the top, many marginalized factions are stirring, beginning to conspire against your authority.'\n\nXi felt a sharp pain in his head, rubbing his temple. He had already had to swallow the bitter fruit of his shortsightedness. His most trusted aides were of little help in this regard."
china.250.d.b: "Today, breaking news shocked all of China: Li Keqiang, the former member of the Politburo Standing Committee and Premier of the State Council, who was just dismissed from all positions, died suddenly from a heart attack in Shanghai at the age of not yet 70. This is extremely unbelievable for a Chinese leader, who usually enjoys good healthcare.\n\nIt is reported that after Li Keqiang resigned following the Taiwan Strait war, he was assigned to live in Shanghai under a form of de facto house arrest. After falling into a coma, the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee immediately organized a medical team for emergency treatment, but to no avail. Currently, after announcing Li’s death, the Chinese government has not taken further action.\n\nIn the depressed atmosphere following the Taiwan Strait war, Li’s sudden death deepened the sense of disillusionment among the Chinese people. Various conspiracy theories have arisen regarding Li’s 'early death,' with some speculating that the new leadership had him secretly assassinated out of fear of his influence, or intentionally delayed his treatment. Public security departments across the country have been ordered to closely monitor and control anti-government dissent groups who may seize the opportunity to oppose the new government."
PRC_MAO.59.t:0 "Victory in War?"
PRC_MAO.59.d:0 "The Taiwan Strait war has finally ended. Our flag flies in the designated place, but the cheers have not resounded across China. The victory on the battlefield failed to cover up the failure of another battle: the economic collapse is tearing apart our already fragile social structure.\n\nDuring the war, we chose a strategy of limited conflict to avoid disturbing society with a full mobilization. However, this caution sowed the seeds of economic turmoil. Foreign capital quickly withdrew at the start of the war, global supply chain nodes were cut off, manufacturing exports sharply decreased, and domestic businesses were crushed by material shortages and market blockades.\n\nThe noise in the streets and alleys has turned into low murmurs of complaints: store shelves are becoming emptier, everyday goods prices are soaring. The unemployment wave is sweeping coastal cities, countless factories have shut down, and workers crowd employment centers only to find them powerless. The international financial markets have pushed us into the abyss, with currency devaluation and capital flight, like a wild horse running free and impossible to retrieve.\n\nIn the lights of the Great Hall of the People, the Central Committee faces a tricky problem: how to calm the turbulent public sentiment? Victory should have been a booster for consolidating power, but now it has become a burning fuse. The international community’s economic sanctions and domestic capital’s panic flight have dragged this dragon into the mire."

 china.167.d: "Despite our powerful military strength and being the world’s largest economy, we had prepared thoroughly before the war, solely to accomplish reunification, yet we still paid an enormous price in the confrontation with the same fake government.\n\nThe consequences of the war were catastrophic. Our army was weakened post-war, morale was low, and combat readiness was insufficient. The economic impact was equally severe, with sanctions worsening our predicament and leading investors, private enterprises, and major foreign companies to withdraw due to concerns over the stability of investments in China. Public reaction was also intense. Although we tried to downplay and suppress news of public protests, demonstrations calling for Xi Jinping and his team to step down spread like wildfire. The scale had already surpassed the control of local police forces, and with our military still in disarray, only the armed police and various paramilitary groups could provide support. Given the escalation of violence, surging crowds, and our possibly insufficient response capabilities, casualties seemed unavoidable.\n\nThe road to recovery will certainly be difficult and arduous, and internal divisions may allow other factions within the Party to plot. Particularly, the hardliners in the military and within the Communist Party, once they recover from the failure, might attempt a coup. Though these are currently mere speculations, the key now is to plan the next steps and ensure the nation is not trapped by both internal and external enemies."
PRC_MAO.58.t:0 "Reading Club"
PRC_MAO.58.d:0 "The evening sky was low, with sparse starlight. Yang Heping’s study was brightly lit, with warm yellow light enveloping the desk covered with books and manuscripts. He sat in a wicker chair, slightly reclined, with the usual calm smile on his face. The study was crowded with students, some standing, some sitting on the floor, all with different expressions, but all captivated by the special night talk.\n\n'Teacher, this war has been going on for so long...' a student sitting next to the bookshelf couldn’t help but speak, anxiety in his voice. 'Everyone’s life is becoming harder. There’s a shortage of supplies, and many families are starting to worry about their next meal. What should we do?' \n\nThe room fell silent, all eyes turned to Yang Heping. He lifted his head, squinting slightly, his gaze sweeping across every student’s face. He paused for a moment, then smiled lightly, his voice slow yet rhythmic: 'Well, war, it’s always like this between imperialist nations.'\n\nHis nonchalant attitude made a few students frown. 'But teacher,' another student eagerly responded, 'You’ve been banned as well. Your articles and videos are nowhere to be found, even your social media accounts have been suspended. What can we do under these circumstances?' \n\nYang Heping’s smile deepened. He didn’t answer directly but leaned back in his chair, his fingers gently tapping on the armrest, as if pondering how to tell a fable about the times. 'They always think too highly of themselves, believing they can solve problems with war and suppress voices with censorship. However, these tactics will only sharpen the contradictions. If we want to avoid disaster, we must learn to stand with the people, not against them.'\n\nHe said, reaching for a pen on the desk and sketching a few strokes on a notebook that had been casually opened. 'Remember,' he said slowly, his gaze firm but gentle, 'No matter how the situation changes, the people are the true masters of history. What we can do is make them realize this and let their voices rise.'\n\nThe students fell into deep thought. The study was filled with a complex emotion, both confusion and a faint sense of hope.\n\n'What about us?' A lower-grade student hesitantly asked. 'What can we do?' \n\nYang Heping set the pen down and sat up straight. His voice was low, but carried a penetrating power: 'Be patient and observe calmly. Remember, in any turmoil, the most important thing is not to rush into following the superficial voices, but to see the essence of the problem. In wars between imperialists, they fight till the skies darken, but in the end, they always return to the negotiating table. But the people’s voices are different, they carry power, and once awakened, they won’t be easily suppressed.'\n\nThe wind outside gently blew, bringing a slight chill, but the light in the room still shone brightly. Yang Heping’s wicker chair swayed slightly, seemingly lost in deep contemplation, while the students felt an imperceptible shock in this quiet moment.\n\nThe long night talk ended. As the students left, they glanced back at the study, where Yang Heping still sat, holding a pen, as though sketching some future blueprint. His shadow flickered on the curtains, swaying slightly, much like this era—full of uncertainty, yet faintly anticipating the arrival of dawn."

PRC_MAO.57.d:0 "The morning sun broke through the thick smog, casting faint shadows on the streets. However, the city on this day was anything but calm. The shouting crowd gathered in the square, holding banners, and their cries surged like a tidal wave.\n\n'End the war!' 'Stop the control!' 'Give us freedom!'\n\nThe angry shouts pierced the sky, entering the ears of every passerby.\n\nThe atmosphere in the square was unusually tense. Among the crowd were elderly people and young people, their faces full of dissatisfaction and anger. An elderly man in his sixties held a hand-written sign that read: 'We cannot wait any longer!' His eyes were firm, but deep fatigue could not be hidden. Beside him stood a girl in a school uniform, her voice hoarse but still shouting slogans, tears mixed with sweat sliding down her face.\n\nAt the same time, protests were raging across the country. From the southern coastal cities to the northern industrial hubs, from bustling metropolises to quiet small towns, tens of thousands of people flooded the streets, expressing their dissatisfaction with the current situation. On social media, videos, pictures, and texts about the protests spread like wildfire, each repost, each comment pushing the situation further.\n\n'Shortages of supplies, how much longer can we hold on?' \n'Only one kilogram of rice per day, what will the children eat?' \n'We can’t pay the mortgage, the bank is threatening to take our house.'\n\nSuch voices were heard everywhere. Those who had once been content with their situation now stepped out of their homes and joined the protests. Their demands were simple and clear: end the war as soon as possible and restore normal life.\n\nHowever, the anger on the streets did not stop at peaceful expressions. In some areas, protests gradually turned into confrontations. In an industrial city in the east, a group of enraged protesters tried to break through the barricade at the government building, facing off with fully armed police. Burning tires sent black smoke into the gray sky. A brick flew through the air and hit a police shield, followed by a series of angry shouts and screams.\n\n'They can’t hear us!' \n'Let them see our strength!' \n\nAs emotions spiraled out of control, more confrontations spread across the country. The government tried to contain the situation, mobilizing police forces to maintain order, but each suppression only made the situation more uncontrollable. Some protesters even began to block transportation hubs, forcing the railway system to stop, highways to be paralyzed, and intercity logistics to nearly collapse.\n\nAlthough our statement was quickly released, calling for calm and emphasizing that we were working to solve the problems, such words had already failed to calm the public’s anger. More voices began to question the meaning and cost of the war:\n\n'Who is this really for?' \n'We’ve paid too much, why should we continue?' \n\nAs night fell, the protests continued. The protesters, under the dim streetlights, appeared to grow in number, while the surrounding security lines tightened. The loudspeakers from afar broadcast continuous exhortations, but they seemed insignificant in the midst of the crowd’s shouts.\n\nA storm was brewing, and no one could predict the next direction. The front lines were unbroken, but internal troubles were rising. If the situation could not be resolved quickly, the flames of this protest might burn even higher, igniting more people’s anger and ultimately pushing the entire nation toward an unbearable abyss."

PRC_MAO.56.d:0 "The night sky was like a giant curtain, heavy on Li Ran’s shoulders. He huddled in a corner of an alley, hands over his head, his body trembling with suppressed sobs. His belief, the one that had once supported him to angrily denounce 'traitors' and support everything, seemed to have collapsed overnight.\n\nA few days ago, the scene of Li Ning being taken away by the police kept flashing in his mind. He was his only friend, the one who, though equally angry, chose to submit the truth to the authorities. But now? Li Ning had been gone for several days, and there was no news.\n\n'Why...' Li Ran muttered, his eyes blank, staring at the ground. The screen of his phone was lit up, playing that video. The dialogue in the video was like a sharp blade, each sentence piercing through his former beliefs. He knew he had to do something.\n\nPerhaps it was because he had been kicked out of his house that he had become a nameless wanderer. It was this situation that gave him an inexplicable sense of freedom. He gritted his teeth, his trembling fingers uploading the video online. In that instant, it felt like a wave of heat surged from his chest. He had an unprecedented feeling—relief, but also deep fear.\n\nThe following days, he felt trapped in the shadow of his past, each step a confrontation with himself. During the day, he remained silent and powerless in the crowd, like a leaf floating on the surface of the water; at night, he couldn’t sleep, his mind filled with those past images. He heard his own roar, saw his own face angrily denouncing the opponents, like a twisted incarnation.\n\nFinally, one night, he stood in front of a white wall, holding a spray can. His fingers hesitated for a moment on the switch, then he pressed it without hesitation. Red paint poured out, and large characters appeared on the wall:\n\n'We need the truth!'\n\nHis heart raced, the bright red letters shining under the dim streetlights. His hand didn’t stop, and he sprayed a simplified human face beneath, with the words: \n\n'Where is Li Ning?'\n\nAfter finishing, he stuffed the spray can into his bag and quickly disappeared into the night. His chest was filled with complicated emotions, both fear and excitement, but more than anything, an unspeakable sense of satisfaction.\n\nFrom that day on, his nights gained new meaning. He learned to print out his voice on white paper and paste it on walls, bus stops, and even mirrors in public toilets. He also learned to use different colors to spray, making his words stand out more.\n\nGradually, he noticed a chain reaction to his actions. On social media in other cities, he saw similar graffiti, and some even began using his slogans. 'We need the truth' became a symbolic cry, like a spark that ignited every suppressed voice.\n\nLi Ran stood on a bridge, overlooking the pitch-black city, a strange light flashing in his eyes. He knew he couldn’t stop. His hand tightened around the bag strap, and he walked quickly toward his next target. He was going to resist, he was going to atone for his past, and he was going to be the vanguard of this silent revolution.\n\nIn the night sky, the stars faintly twinkled. They were like the countless suppressed voices in this city, each insignificant, but when gathered, shining brightly. And Li Ran, in that starlight, found a path that belonged to him."

This time, there was no satisfaction from power and wealth, only a chilling fear. His hand tightly gripped his phone, cold sweat trickling down his forehead, dropping onto the desk, forming irregular water stains.\n\n'Who did it? Who did it!' Zhang Wei gritted his teeth and muttered in a low voice, full of panic and anger. He had already realized that the video circulating online these past few days clearly recorded his 'private conversation' with the leadership. The unspeakable words were forwarded, edited, and commented on countless times, now almost becoming the nation's 'headline.'\n\nHe shakily dialed several familiar numbers, but the people who had once promised to protect him now seemed to have disappeared. On the other end of the line, there was either a cold busy tone or a dismissive, evasive response: 'Zhang Wei, just hang in there, it’ll blow over soon.' 'We are also in a tough spot, you know...'\n\n'Bullshit!' Zhang Wei slammed his hand on the desk, his chest heaving violently. He understood now—he had been abandoned. The higher-ups had decided to use him as a scapegoat to quell public anger. Just like discarding a useless pawn, their promises of protection had always been for their own benefit.\n\nVoices from outside the door gradually grew louder, low and chaotic, like an impending storm. The sound of security shouting, glass breaking, mixed with angry curses and screams.\n\n'Zhang Wei! Come out!' \n\nZhang Wei's heart raced. He moved his heavy body, trying to move his desk to block the door, but his strength seemed drained. In the end, he could only sit back down in his chair, staring at the door with wide eyes.\n\nSuddenly, the door was kicked open, followed by a deafening roar. Dozens of angry civilians rushed in, holding iron rods, bricks, and even folders and desk lamps they grabbed from the office. Their eyes were full of rage, like burning flames ready to consume Zhang Wei.\n\n'You bastard! Taking our things for yourself and selling them off? We’re going to kill you today!' A middle-aged man led the charge, swinging a wooden club toward Zhang Wei’s shoulder.\n\nZhang Wei screamed, curling up in his chair, covering his head with his hands. He knew he couldn’t escape—angry mobs wouldn’t let him off easily. He tried to explain, but was drowned out by more punches, kicks, and shouts.\n\n'It wasn’t me! It wasn’t just me! If you’re going to blame someone, blame those leaders, they’re worse than I am!' Zhang Wei suddenly shouted, his voice filled with desperation.\n\nThe room fell silent for a moment, as the words cut deep into the crowd’s emotions.\n\n'What? There’s more?' Someone stopped their action, glaring at him coldly.\n\n'Yes! They made me do it! I have all the names! If you want to take action, go after them, or we’re all just scapegoats!' Zhang Wei said frantically, spilling the names, positions, and relationships of the officials and managers who had worked with him, speaking rapidly.\n\nThe scene was recorded by a few people using their phones. The next day, the video quickly spread across the country through QQ, WeChat groups, Moments, and even small live-streaming platforms. Zhang Wei’s panic, the exposed corruption, and the mob’s angry shouts ignited a wildfire of emotions, completely fueling the suppressed anger."

PRC_MAO.54.d:0 "The streetlights were dim under the night sky, and the breeze carried the chill of early autumn as it gently brushed Li Ning’s face. He enjoyed walking at night—it was a rare time to relax. However, tonight’s calm was broken by a low, muttered curse.\n\nA figure was curled up on a bench by the street, wearing a somewhat thin jacket, with a face full of frustration and exhaustion. The person occasionally lifted their head and cursed at the air, their voice low but filled with undeniable anger: 'It’s all those bastards’ fault! They ruined me, ruined everything!'\n\nLi Ning instinctively slowed his pace. He wasn’t fond of speaking to strangers, but the anger in the person’s voice seemed to resonate with him. After a brief hesitation, he spoke up: 'Hey, brother, you okay?'\n\nThe person looked up, their gaze wary but more filled with resignation. His name was Li Ran, someone drifting under the weight of life and ideals. After a brief exchange of pleasantries, they quickly began discussing their troubles. Li Ran vented about the 'reactionary elements' around him, angrily denouncing those spreading false information, while Li Ning shared his doubts about societal issues.\n\n'Why can’t they understand? The country is trying, and our current difficulties are just temporary,' Li Ran gritted his teeth, clenching his fists.\n\nLi Ning nodded, his tone tinged with helplessness: 'Yeah, but we can’t deny that some people are taking advantage of the country’s hardships to do unspeakable things. The people at the top should be good, it’s just those greedy ones at the bottom that have ruined everything.'\n\nTheir opinions gradually diverged. Li Ran insisted that all the negative news was rumors, part of an attack on the country; Li Ning believed the problems were real, but only due to localized corruption, not a problem with the system itself. Eventually, they both sighed in resignation, falling into silence.\n\nAt that moment, a hearty laugh broke the silence from nearby. Both of them shut their mouths and turned toward the source of the sound. At the end of the street, several middle-aged men in suits were emerging from a brightly lit private club, their faces smug, one of them even waving a cigar. The leader was Zhang Wei, an influential figure in the supply distribution system, with his direct superior beside him.\n\n'Hahaha, you see, we got to pick whatever we wanted from this distribution, right?' Zhang Wei joked, his voice dripping with undisguised disdain. He looked around, confirming no one was around, then leaned in close to his superior, lowering his voice: 'However, the 'special quality' goods should be kept for our people first. We can't let the lower-level folks find out about these little tricks.'\n\nThe superior grinned and patted Zhang Wei on the shoulder: 'You get it! I like you for that. After this time passes, you’ll be well rewarded.'\n\nLi Ran’s face turned pale instantly. His lips trembled but no sound came out, and his hands froze midair as if they had lost all strength. Li Ning narrowed his eyes, took out his phone, and quickly opened the camera.\n\n'What... what are you doing?' Li Ran finally managed to say, his voice trembling.\n\n'Recording,' Li Ning whispered, his eyes cold as he aimed the phone at the group, capturing every movement they made. The bright screen glowed faintly in the night, and Li Ran just stood by, quietly watching, neither stopping nor joining in.\n\nZhang Wei and the others walked further away, their laughter and conversation carried away by the wind, fading into the silence of the night. Li Ran looked at the phone in Li Ning’s hand, as if wanting to say something, but in the end, just closed his mouth.\n\n'I’ll hand this footage to the government, let them punish these parasites properly,' Li Ning said as he put away his phone, his voice low.\n\nLi Ran didn’t respond. His face was filled with a mix of emotions: anger, shame, pain, but more than anything, an unspoken confusion. He stared at the ground, as if seeing the world for the first time, or perhaps, losing himself in it for the first time.\n\nThe night wind blew, carrying the chill of late autumn. Li Ran stood there, seemingly swallowed by the darkness, while Li Ning silently turned and walked in the opposite direction."

PRC_MAO.53.d:0 "Zhang Hongliang's name has recently become a forbidden presence in certain online forums and WeChat groups. His speeches have been blocked, his articles taken down, and even the 'Renaissance Network' forum where he had been active for years was temporarily shut down due to a 'technical failure.' For this old left-wing theorist, none of this was surprising, but it was far heavier than he had imagined.\n\nThe incident that caused the stir was an article he wrote about the Taiwan issue. The title was unremarkable, but every sentence cut to the painful reality: 'Liberating Taiwan: Moral Duty Trumps the Sharp Edge of Force.' In the article, he reflected on the early history of New China, 'At that time, liberating Taiwan was not just a military action to reclaim territory, but a replacement of backward political civilization by advanced political civilization. We brought Taiwan’s people freedom and dignity through free housing, free healthcare, free education, and the thorough elimination of vices like gambling, drugs, and prostitution.'\n\nHe further attacked the current nationalist trends and the 'fifty-cent army' culture, stating: 'Those calling for military unification of Taiwan today seem to have forgotten what earned us the world’s respect. Not the cannon, but morality; not media control, but the trust of the people. Oppressing workers domestically and shouting for war abroad will only strip us of all our moral foundations, leaving us isolated and helpless.'\n\nThe spread of these remarks was like a huge stone thrown into a calm lake, creating ripples that soon turned into a storm. Some old left-wing theorists openly supported him on social media, praising his deep understanding of history and his clear analysis of real-world issues. Others, however, coldly criticized him for 'losing touch with reality' and 'fueling the enemy’s propaganda.' They believed that Zhang Hongliang was too idealistic, ignoring the complexity of the real world, and possibly even inadvertently undermining the country’s current 'unification cause.'\n\nHowever, these debates were just the beginning.\n\nOn an afternoon full of tension, Zhang Hongliang sat in his cramped study, staring at his computer screen. The signal light was flashing, indicating that he had just lost access to social media platforms. He took a deep breath, opened the WeChat group, but found that all the group messages had become gray prompts: 'Content not available.'\n\n'They shut me down fast,' he murmured, a bitter smile curling on his lips.\n\nThe door suddenly knocked, followed by the entrance of his old friend, Professor Wang. Professor Wang, a typical old leftist, walked in with a slightly disdainful expression and said: 'Hongliang, did you go too far this time? Saying these things will only make people think you’ve sided with the traitors.'\n\n'Sided with who?' Zhang Hongliang raised an eyebrow and coldly retorted, 'I stand with the workers and farmers. If that’s considered siding with the traitors, then I’ll accept that label.'\n\nProfessor Wang sighed deeply and said earnestly, 'But you must also consider reality. Now is a time for unity, not division.'\n\n'Unity?' Zhang Hongliang suddenly stood up, his voice filled with restrained anger, 'Unity with those who shout for war online but ignore the exploitation of workers? Or unity with those who only shout nationalist slogans but know nothing of real socialist values?' \n\nThe room fell silent for a moment. Professor Wang shook his head and turned to leave, leaving behind a disappointed figure.\n\nThat evening, Zhang Hongliang sat alone at his desk, the dim desk lamp casting a soft light. He opened a heavy notebook, turned to the first page, and wrote a few words: 'Morality and Civilization.' This was the title of his new article, but he wasn’t sure if anyone would be willing to publish it.\n\nMeanwhile, the split within the left-wing had become unavoidable. Supporters of Zhang Hongliang believed that the country must return to true socialist values to solve internal and external problems; those against him warned that if his remarks continued to spread, it would only further weaken the left-wing’s image in society, and even cause greater political risks.\n\nRegardless of who was right or wrong, Zhang Hongliang knew that his era was slipping away. Yet he still firmly believed that history would prove him right. He looked up and gazed at the night sky outside the window. The bright star seemed to remind him that standing firm in solitude was also part of revolution."

He had heard people say that during wartime, military production often activates the entire economic chain. Factories work overtime, transportation is busy, and everywhere is short of labor. With this in mind, he tightly gripped the resume in his pocket, as if the war had opened a new door for him.\n\n'Brother Qiang, do you think we’ll have a chance?' his neighbor, Old Liu, ran over with hope in his eyes.\n\n'Definitely!' Zhang Qiang nodded vigorously, as if encouraging someone else, but also comforting himself, 'We’re just waiting for the opportunity!' \n\nThey began closely following the news, walking around the employment market every day. As soon as they heard a rumor that a military factory might be hiring or that more transport workers were needed somewhere, they would rush there immediately. But over the past few days, their wait had always ended in disappointment.\n\nGradually, a few weeks passed, and the war raged on, but the news they were hoping for never appeared. Day after day, the disappointment spread between them, but no one dared to break the silence. Every time they met, their conversations circled, until one day, reality slapped them hard and shattered all their illusions.\n\nThat morning, Zhang Qiang and a group of people gathered at the entrance of the recruitment market. He tightly gripped his already crumpled resume, his eyes still filled with the last bit of hope. At that moment, a uniformed official stepped onto the stage, opened a red-headed document, and began to read aloud.\n\n'Given that this war is of limited scale, the national strategic focus is on high-tech and efficient use of existing reserves, with no need to expand traditional production lines. We ask the public to understand the government's decision and continue to respond to the call for collective effort during this difficult time.'\n\nZhang Qiang froze. He felt as if cold stones had been thrown into his chest. Old Liu beside him slightly opened his mouth but didn’t make a sound. A few seconds later, people around them began whispering, complaining, and sighing, creating an oppressive noise.\n\n'Is that it? Just saying we’re not needed?' A young man couldn’t help but shout.\n\n'I knew not to expect anything from this damn war...' Another person ground his teeth, his voice filled with deep helplessness.\n\nZhang Qiang said nothing. His hand dropped, and the resume fell to the ground, blown slightly open by the wind. He stared at the paper, his mind blank. He remembered the hopeful self from the beginning, now feeling absurd and ridiculous.\n\n'War wasn’t meant for us,' he finally whispered, unsure if he was speaking to others or to himself.\n\nAs the crowd gradually dispersed, the square became quiet again. He stood in the empty street, feeling an indescribable emptiness. No job, no future, and even waiting seemed meaningless. The wind swept up the litter on the ground, and Zhang Qiang turned and walked away, his shadow stretching long on the ground."

PRC_MAO.51.t:0 "Necessary Sacrifices"
PRC_MAO.51.d:0 "The shadow of the Taiwan Strait war has now spread beyond being just images on television and numbers in the news. It has begun to permeate everyone’s daily life, becoming an underlying worry behind every conversation, every exchanged glance.\n\nWang Lin stood at the limited-purchase counter in the supermarket, clutching a new ration card. This card had been issued by the government just days ago, claiming it was for fairer distribution of resources, requiring everyone to purchase essential items like rice, flour, and oil with a ration card. She looked down at the words on the card and understood what 'fairness' meant: the monthly limit was even less than her usual weekly consumption.\n\nThe supermarket was packed with people, the air filled with noisy conversations and barely audible sighs. Some people walked by with empty shopping carts, their eyes wandering as if searching for something or calculating something; others whispered complaints, their voices mixed with anger and helplessness.\n\n'They’ve started limiting purchases, how are we supposed to live?' A middle-aged man said to his wife. His wife lowered her head in silence, clutching the shopping basket tightly.\n\n'Don’t complain, everyone is in the same boat, right? Just bear with it, the war will be over soon,' another voice came from the side, though it didn’t sound very convincing.\n\nWang Lin silently listened to these conversations, her heart filled with mixed emotions. She understood these people's worries, and also understood that wars always come with a price. She tried to comfort herself in her mind: 'This is just temporary, it will pass.'\n\nWhen it was her turn, the staff at the counter handed her a small cloth bag, inside which was the allocated rice and a few bottles of oil. The bag was light, she could even carry it with one hand. When the staff handed it over, they said nothing, only giving a tired look signaling the next person. Wang Lin took the bag, took a deep breath, silently calculating how long these supplies would last.\n\nWalking out of the supermarket, the street was still bustling, but everyone’s pace seemed heavy. In the shop windows, price tags had big 'Limited Purchase' labels on them, and some shelves were already empty. A few young people stood by the roadside, quietly discussing: 'When will the war be over? How are we supposed to survive with these shortages?'\n\n'Stop thinking so much,' one of them patted his companion on the shoulder, trying to sound light-hearted, 'It’ll pass.'\n\nWang Lin hoped so too. She looked up at the sky, the gray sky with no sunlight, just like the dark clouds hanging over everyone’s hearts at this moment.\n\nOn her way home, the street broadcasts were playing the government's announcement, the voice loud and calm: 'The rationing policy is to ensure the basic living conditions of all citizens. Please cooperate with the government’s decisions and support each other through this difficult time. We firmly believe that victory will ultimately belong to us.'"

PRC_MAO.50.d:0 "Zhang Wei sat in his office, piled high with files and reports, as sunlight streamed through the gap in the curtains onto the floor. He held a steaming cup of red tea, his face displaying an unmistakable sense of pride. He knew that, in this time of material shortages and widespread insecurity, the power in his hands was invaluable.\n\nThe papers on the desk were the latest inventory list for the neighborhood’s supply. He casually flipped through it, his gaze locking onto a few prominent high-quality items: top-tier imported milk, high-quality flour, premium canned goods, and several boxes of newly arrived medical supplies. He nodded lightly, moving these items into a special "internal backup" folder.\n\n“Still need to pick the better ones,” Zhang Wei muttered, his fingers typing slowly on the keyboard. He set aside a few boxes of premium goods, planning to trade them later for cash or even rarer items through trusted black market channels. The remaining goods, after careful selection, were allocated to relatives and his own household to ensure everything was taken care of. As for the lower-quality supplies, they could be “fairly” distributed to the increasingly vocal ordinary residents.\n\nHe put the pen down, leaned back in his chair, and took a deep breath. At that moment, his phone lit up, with a transfer reminder showing another payment for a black market deal. A smile curled at the corner of his mouth. “This really is the best of times.”\n\nZhang Wei didn’t see himself as a greedy man. He was simply going with the flow. Distributing supplies was never easy—everyone wanted more and better, and he was simply ensuring his family and “reciprocal friends” weren’t left wanting. He even thought his actions were just “common sense.” After all, rules are rigid, but people are alive. He was a smart person, and smart people always find the loopholes in the rules.\n\nThese days, his bank balance grew every day, and his refrigerator at home had never been so full. What satisfied him the most was the new imported air conditioner in the living room. And as for the ordinary residents complaining about the quality of the supplies, they were nothing more than muttering quietly while queuing at the distribution points—what’s there to fear?\n\nJust then, there was a light knock at the office door. Zhang Wei wiped the smile off his face, straightened his posture, and said calmly, “Come in.” A young subordinate walked in cautiously, handing over a file. “Director Zhang, here’s the distribution plan for the next batch of supplies. Please review it.”\n\nHe flipped through the file—it was another opportunity. He looked up at his subordinate, speaking in a tone that was gentle but still authoritative: “Xiao Wang, refine these plans a bit more, especially the high-quality items. Make sure the distribution is more precise to ensure everyone is satisfied.”\n\nXiao Wang nodded, leaving the office with a barely noticeable cold glint in his eyes.\n\nZhang Wei didn’t notice these details. He leaned back in his chair, humming an old tune, as the sun set outside the window. The entire street was gradually bathed in a warm orange light. He gazed out the window, secretly thinking about the black market prices for tonight’s deals. In an era of turmoil, for him, it was the perfect opportunity to get rich. He even thought, maybe this “good time” could last a little longer."

PRC_MAO.49.d:0 "Li Ran’s life had become exceptionally monotonous, yet filled with passion. Every morning, the first thing he did was open his phone, scroll through social media, and search for those 'anti-national' comments. He considered himself a 'digital warrior' defending the country—reporting, rebutting, debating—keeping himself busy. Every time he saw a notification that an account had been banned, he felt an overwhelming sense of relief. Yet, the dissenting voices continued to sprout up like mushrooms after the rain, making him both angry and exhausted.\n\nThat day, his mood was even more irritable. Someone had posted online about the outrageous rise in food prices, and another complained that a relative had died due to a shortage of medicine. He looked at these accusations, clenched his fists, and almost wanted to storm to the screen to teach these 'whiners' a lesson. 'Can’t they see how hard the country is fighting in the war? These people don’t deserve to be called citizens!' He angrily pressed the report button, letting out a long sigh.\n\nThat evening, he dragged his weary body home. He opened the door to find the room dimly lit, with his father sitting on the sofa, the TV showing a news segment about the economic situation. Li Ran casually asked, 'Dad, what’s for dinner?' His father didn’t answer, instead muttering under his breath, 'More of this nonsense, always talking about nothing. What’s the use?' \n\nLi Ran paused, rooted to the spot. He had never heard his father speak like this—the man who always buried himself in work, who had never cared much for politics.\n\n'Dad, what did you just say?' His voice trembled slightly.\n\n'I said, these people up top don’t understand the suffering of those below! I’ve lost my job, my family can barely make ends meet, and all they do is shout slogans!' \n\nThese words were like a sharp stab, digging into Li Ran’s nerves. His emotions exploded instantly, and he shouted loudly, 'Dad! How can you say that? Have you become one of those spreading rumors? The country is struggling, how can you not understand?! Is this how you’re going to be a Chinese citizen?' \n\nHis voice shook the glass in the living room. His father suddenly looked up, shocked, furrowing his brow. After a moment, the man stood up, his eyes burning with anger.\n\n'What’s wrong with me?! I lost my job, my income is gone, it’s hard to support the family! Is that my fault? I want to understand, but who understands me?! Li Ran, you’re an adult now, right? Then go live your life! Get out!' \n\nHis voice was hoarse but deafening. Li Ran stood there in a daze, as his father went to the door, opened it, and pointed outside, 'Go on! You think I’m wrong? Then don’t stay here! Go out and fight for the things you’re defending!' \n\nLi Ran’s lips trembled. He wanted to argue but couldn’t find the words. He gritted his teeth, grabbed his backpack in a hurry, and stormed out, not looking back. The door slammed behind him, and the cold night wind rushed in.\n\nHe stood in the hallway, the angry shouts of his father echoing in his ears. The anger, frustration, and helplessness in his heart tangled together. He wanted to cry, but his eyes felt dry and painful. He only felt that, in this moment, the world seemed to have shut him out. His hand gently touched the cold wall of the corridor, and he muttered softly, 'Did I do something wrong?' But his voice was drowned in the silence of the deep night."

PRC_MAO.48.t:0 "The Distribution Scandal"
PRC_MAO.48.d:0 "Li Ning was a third-year university student, a firm believer in the policies of the Party and the state. He always proudly said, 'Every step the country takes is carefully thought out, supporting it is my responsibility.' After the war broke out, his patriotism nearly overflowed onto his social media—sharing posts in support, angrily rebutting 'negative comments,' keeping himself busy. Li Ning believed his faith was pure.\n\nHowever, one night, a video suddenly went viral. It was a secretly filmed clip: a staff member at a city’s supply distribution center was caught picking out high-quality rice, oil, powdered milk, and medicines from a pile of supplies and putting them into their own car, while the supplies given to the public were expired or substandard. The comments below the video exploded like a volcano: 'Absolutely shameless!' 'Such corrupt officials should be shot!' 'Is this our 'supply guarantee'?' \n\nLi Ning stared at the screen, stunned for a few seconds. The content of the video made him uneasy, but he quickly calmed himself down. 'It can’t be the policy’s fault,' he reassured himself, 'These people are just greedy and selfish, distorting the higher-ups’ arrangements.'\n\nThe next day, the authorities issued a brief news release: the individuals involved had been criticized by the Party and reassigned. This announcement quickly sparked greater controversy, with angry voices spreading across the streets. Li Ning saw the furious posts on the campus forum and couldn’t help but pound the table as he commented, 'They’ve already been criticized, what more do you want? The government’s intentions were good, but some scoundrels ruined the execution. Even in wartime, we can’t question the general direction!' \n\nBut this time, his comment didn’t receive agreement, but rather mockery. 'Are you blind?' 'No amount of good intentions will fix these real issues.' 'Li Ning, stop whitewashing, wake up.' He grew increasingly angry and quickly closed the page.\n\nThe atmosphere on campus started to shift. He noticed fewer people discussing these topics in the dorm, and even when someone did bring it up, the conversation was quickly cut off. He tried to discuss it with his roommates, but they repeatedly brushed him off: 'Oh, yes, you’re right.' Even Zhang Qiang, who loved debating with him, no longer responded, just burying himself in his papers.\n\nOne noon, he walked into the cafeteria, only to find the portions had noticeably shrunk. Some students whispered as they stood in line: 'The supply problem isn’t solved yet, I really don’t know what to do next.' Li Ning felt frustrated and said loudly, 'These are small problems! The country is already acting, stop being so pessimistic!' The once noisy line suddenly fell silent, and several people turned to look at him, but no one spoke.\n\nLi Ning sat down with his tray but noticed the table around him was nearly empty. Only a few students were glancing at him from a distance, whispering something, then walking away. He felt a sense of emptiness, but stubbornly told himself, 'It’s them who are shortsighted, they don’t understand the bigger picture, I’m fine.'"

PRC_MAO.47.t:0 "Catching Traitors"
PRC_MAO.47.d:0 "Li Ran was an ordinary college student from a small southern city. When the news of the war broke, he and his roommates were chomping on instant noodles, eagerly watching the news. The screen flashed with images of missile launches, and in the heated comment section, Li Ran’s post was pinned to the top: 'This day has finally come! The military unification is just, unification is a must!'\n\nAt first, Li Ran felt that everything he saw was justified and honorable. He was immersed in a huge sense of historical mission, feeling as if, despite being a student, he could participate in this grand tide of history through words and actions. However, as time passed, the atmosphere around him began to change.\n\nThe first complaints came about rising prices. The small corner shop had increased the price of instant noodles by 30%, and at the local market, eggs had become a luxury. Li Ran didn’t care about these things. He sneered at his roommate Zhang Qiang’s complaints: 'This is the necessary price of war, don’t talk nonsense!' Zhang Qiang didn’t retort, but later quietly switched from takeout to eating at the cafeteria.\n\nThe shortage of supplies was just the beginning. On the campus forum, voices began to spread—someone posted pictures of empty supermarket shelves, and others wrote posts complaining 'the war is only making ordinary people suffer.' Li Ran became increasingly furious, almost wanting to reply with insults. But when he scrolled through the comments, he found some people actually supported these 'nonsense' posts, making him even more enraged.\n\n'These people, what else could they be but traitors!' Li Ran shouted in the dorm. His voice echoed harshly in the dim room, and several roommates exchanged glances, then lowered their heads, continuing to play on their phones.\n\nWhat really made Li Ran furious was his classmate, Zhou Kai, from the next dorm. Zhou Kai’s parents were executives at a multinational corporation. A few days ago, Zhou Kai had mentioned in class that employees from his family’s company had been laid off, speaking passionately: 'In this situation, not speaking out is simply unfair!' Li Ran, hearing this, was immediately filled with rage, and retorted, 'Your family made all this money off Chinese people, now that you're facing some difficulties, you complain? Don’t you have any conscience?' \n\nThe argument between the two led to a complete falling out, but that wasn’t the end. A few days later, the campus was abuzz with 'news'—a few students had been taken away for spreading harmful rhetoric and causing public confusion. Zhou Kai was among them.\n\n'Good job catching them!' Li Ran stood at the edge of the playground, listening to the discussions, and clapped his hands. He saw Zhou Kai being pushed into a police car by several officers, his head lowered, without resistance. The surroundings buzzed with whispers, mixed with some heavy sighs.\n\n'Those scoundrels, they should’ve been dealt with long ago!' Li Ran stood tall, his sense of justice burning like a sword, striking at all the 'enemies.'"

PRC_MAO.46.d:0 "Today, a piece of news from Taiwan has attracted global attention. The Taiwanese government announced that they had successfully repelled the first wave of China’s intense offensive. Although the situation remains dire, it is clear that the tide has shifted in Taiwan’s favor. This news quickly became a headline, and the global focus on the war escalated.\n\nTaiwan’s Military Command Center issued a statement, claiming that after two weeks of fierce fighting, the Taiwanese army had successfully repelled China’s surprise attack. Their fortifications and precision-guided weapons played a crucial role. The Taiwanese commanders stated that, although the enemy remained defiant, the first wave of attacks had been thoroughly defeated, and Taiwan’s coordinated efforts had won them precious strategic time.\n\nMeanwhile, the international community quickly responded, with the most notable reaction coming from the Quad. A spokesperson for the organization expressed congratulations on Taiwan’s defense achievements and promised to strengthen strategic support for Taiwan. Both Japan and Australia publicly declared they would provide military and logistical support to ensure Taiwan maintained its strategic advantage.\n\nIn stark contrast, China’s government took a different approach. Despite the evident setbacks in the Chinese military, the Chinese government has yet to make a public response. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a brief statement just hours ago, mentioning that 'the initial fluctuations in the war are normal, and any hostile actions will be appropriately addressed.' However, this statement offered no further details and did not directly comment on Taiwan’s successful defense."

PRC_revive_peoples_war_mindset_4: "Cleanse the People’s Liberation Army"
PRC_revive_peoples_war_mindset_4_desc: "The name 'People’s Liberation Army' now feels like an irony, a dark humor of history that cannot be concealed. The people once gave it this name, hoping it would fight for the liberation of the proletariat, living for the benefit of the people. However, the PLA, a force that should have guarded the flames of revolution, has repeatedly pointed its guns at its own people, turning its loyalty into a blood-stained butcher’s knife. From the Guangxi massacre during the Cultural Revolution, to the Tiananmen Square incident in 1989, to the atrocities at the end of the Taiwan Strait War, the blood of the people has soaked the 'liberation' flag countless times. Time and time again, the army betrayed its original purpose.\n\nThis army, once the backbone of the proletarian revolution, has long since fallen into a part of the authoritarian machine, escorting the privileged and profiting from corruption. Repeated suppression, repeated massacres, with bullets precisely piercing the chest of the innocent, while forgetting the original call of revolution. It once was the heart of the nation, but now, every beat of its heart seems to mock the patience and sacrifices of the people. How can this army still talk about 'liberation'? It is shackles, it is the accomplice of oppression, it is a symbol of betrayal to revolutionary ideals.\n\nBut the times have changed. The wheel of history is rolling forward. The people, once oppressed by the army, now have the strength to face this monstrous beast. The 'military party' no longer stands tall. The power of the militias rises from the grassroots. The barrel of the gun is no longer a privilege of the few. The power of revolution is being reshaped, and countless armed people’s forces are already forming. Their faith no longer submits to the ghosts of the past, but is fighting for true freedom and justice. This time, the people are no longer helpless victims when faced with oppression, but are conscious revolutionaries, armed with the power to defend their rights and freedom.\n\nAs for those generals who seized power and betrayed the people? Their actions, carried out in the name of 'discipline' but in truth committing murder, have long been nailed to the judgment table of history. From the butchers who directed the Cultural Revolution massacre, to the masterminds behind the 1989 crackdown, to the officers in the Taiwan Strait War who used 'national interest' to suppress dissent, their actions have exposed the corruption and cold-bloodedness of the high ranks of the PLA. These tumors will eventually be excised by the judgment of the people, swept thoroughly into the garbage heap of history.\n\nNow, the clarion call for purging has sounded! The power of the people will ruthlessly tear away the false mask, exposing the corruption and tumors hidden within the light of day. The traitorous parasites will be sent one by one to the people's courts for the most just judgment. And this army will be reshaped into a true people's armed force, no longer a tool of power, but the defender of the revolution.\n\nFrom today, 'People’s Liberation Army' will no longer be an empty symbol, but an existence redefined with meaning. The power of the people has awakened, and the wave of revolution will no longer stop. Those who attempt to betray the people and kill the revolution will never escape the punishment of history, and true freedom and liberation will bloom with the brightest light in this cleansing!" 
PRC_revive_peoples_war_mindset_2: "Reform the Militias"
PRC_revive_peoples_war_mindset_2_desc: "The torch of revolution requires strong arms to hold it high, and the militia system, as the last line of defense for national security, must undergo thorough reform. In the face of the complex international situation of the new century and the needs of domestic revolutionary development, the militia system can no longer remain in the passive defensive stage of the past. Lenin once said that the working class must firmly hold onto its right to arm itself. However, the exercise of this right must be established within an orderly and secure framework, to avoid chaotic misuse and unnecessary risks. Revolutionary weapons must not lose control, but they must also never disappear!\n\nFrom today, we will begin comprehensive militia reform, redesigning the armed rights of Chinese citizens in a top-down manner. Workers and farmers, as the core of the proletariat, will be granted limited permission to carry firearms. The qualification to possess firearms will be granted through rigorous screening and training, issued by the state, and closely linked to the militia system. Every militia unit will be expanded in an orderly manner according to central government plans, accepting assignments and drills within designated areas. The issuance of firearms will be strictly documented and managed with advanced systems to ensure their use aligns with the overall interests of the national revolution.\n\nUnder this system, workers and farmers can become legal holders of revolutionary weapons, but only under the supervision and organization of the state. The militia units will be reorganized with higher levels of organization and discipline. The proletariat's armed forces will not only be a tool for workers to defend their rights but also a deterrent barrier against the remnants of capitalism. The barrel of the gun will no longer be detached from the core control of the revolution, but its reach will extend to every corner of the people, providing the final line of defense for resisting tyranny and protecting their own interests. This reform is a continuation of revolutionary spirit, and a powerful supplement to the modern national security system. The proletariat’s right to arm itself is no longer a fantasy, but a concrete existence, standing on top of orderly reform to safeguard the red foundation of the nation."
PRC_revive_peoples_war_mindset_3: "Arms Belong to the People"
PRC_revive_peoples_war_mindset_3_desc: "The power of revolution lies within the people. Lenin’s words still resonate like the morning bell and evening drum, reminding us: The working class must hold the right to bear arms! History has proven that only when the people take up weapons can they truly control their own fate. The bloodline of revolution must not be drained, and the ownership of the barrel of the gun must return to the people — this is the core right of the proletariat and the strongest weapon to completely destroy tyranny and class oppression.\n\nIn the new revolutionary process, we will implement the 'People’s Armed' plan in a bottom-up manner. Grassroots militia units will become the cornerstone of this system. Each militia unit will be directly selected, organized, and managed from the people, becoming a true proletarian revolutionary armed force. The restrictions on the right to bear arms will be significantly relaxed. Every worker, farmer, and even ordinary citizen will have the opportunity to legally own their weapons and directly participate in the grassroots defense of national security. Revolutionary weapons will no longer belong to a few elites or a centralized state machine, but to the millions of revolutionary people. Each militia unit will form autonomous organizations based on communities, managing the distribution, training, and use of weapons, ensuring rights while maintaining order.\n\nThis bottom-up approach to arming the people is the most thorough expression of proletarian revolutionary rights. The weapons in the hands of the people are no longer an illusion, but a vibrant reality. From the countryside to the cities, from the fields to the factories, the guns of revolution will be deeply rooted in the hands of the people, becoming the strongest tool for fighting class oppression and external threats. More importantly, this people's armed force embodies the true 'proletarian dictatorship': revolutionary power is not just a promise written on paper, but a right that the people themselves truly possess and exercise. We no longer rely on the monopoly of power by the few, but instead, every bullet fired by the revolution will be aimed at securing the victory of the proletariat.\n\nUnder the concept of 'People’s Armed', firearms are no longer cold tools, but extensions of revolutionary ideals, embodiments of proletarian power. They give every ordinary person the ability to defend their own freedom and ensure that tyranny can never be restored. This era has already changed, and the future of revolution will breathe new life from the gunshots at the grassroots level! The people’s right to arm themselves, like an ever-burning torch, will light up every inch of the land in the future."

And those exploiters cloaked in academic robes — the academic feudal lords, monopolize academic resources, sit atop the power pyramid, and build an airtight network of interests. Those who wish to enter this high wall either have their wings broken or are forced to sacrifice their conscience to buy a ticket inside. This system not only destroys the individual but also seriously hinders social progress and the true prosperity of science.\n\nHowever, all of this will collapse under the impact of the new wave of revolution! The great revolution will not only overturn political decay but will also awaken the deep consciousness of education. Every chain of the old system must be shattered, and the new education system must be built on the foundation of the people. The examination system — this chain used by the bourgeoisie to screen 'successors' — will be abolished! Countless families will no longer be anxious over scores, and countless students will no longer have to stay up late to study for a cold ranking. The college entrance examination, this institutionalized 'elimination game', along with its class nature, will be thrown into the trash heap of history.\n\nIn its place will be the brand-new 'People’s Education' — with revolution as its core and the people as its subject. Labor and study will be combined, and the goal will be to cultivate fully developed socialist workers, not the exam tools of the old era. The return of the recommendation system, no longer tainted by bloodline theory, will be rooted in the practice of democratic participation. Every hardworking worker, every humble farmer, and every laborer who contributes to society can, through community and collective recommendations, send their children to higher institutions for further education.\n\nThe power base of the academic feudal lords will also be completely uprooted in the education revolution. Academic resources will no longer be monopolized by the few, and authority will no longer be synonymous with academia. Scientific projects and academic research will be fully open, and everyone can participate in scientific exploration based on practice and ability. The decentralized academic system is replacing the old pyramid structure. Every invention and every progress will belong to all the people.\n\nThe goal of education will no longer be to create score machines but to liberate human creativity. The principle of reducing burdens has become the foundation of the new system. Students will no longer be burdened by endless assignments and exams but will find balance in both learning and labor, expanding the future through knowledge and practice. The new education system will cultivate a new generation with ideas, soul, and the ability to change the world, injecting endless power into the continued progress of the revolution and the comprehensive development of society.\n\nThe red flag of revolution will fly in every field of education. The shackles of bourgeois exam-oriented education will be shattered, and the education of the new era, belonging to every people, will rise in the wisdom and strength of the proletariat!"
PRC_baihuaqifang_6: "Clear the Speculators"
PRC_baihuaqifang_6_desc: "The mist of history will eventually clear, and those charlatans who masquerade as 'loyal defenders of the proletariat' will inevitably face the reckoning of history. Zhou Enlai, this opportunist who has been embellished as the 'immortal man', used his humble demeanor and cunning tactics to become the foundation of 'socialism with Chinese characteristics'. Beneath his revolutionary facade, he planted the tumor of class compromise. His so-called 'rationality' and 'moderation' were nothing more than keys to opening the door for the restoration of capitalism. He used his false smiles to gain the trust of the masses, hiding his betrayal of the proletariat under the guise of 'integrity'. He was the mastermind of class compromise, the banner-bearer of the 'moderate' faction, and one of the most deceitful traitors in history.\n\nThe political legacy he left behind — the 'birdcage economy' supported by Chen Yun — is a complete betrayal of socialist principles. This system, while superficially wrapped in the shell of planned economy, actually kept numerous backdoors open for capitalist development. It is precisely this opportunistic and compromising economic policy that has led China’s proletariat into decades of economic exploitation and class conflict. The planned economy in the 'birdcage' is flawed, fragmented, and merely locks the greed of capitalism in a cage without ever intending to destroy it completely. Such compromisers were the true founders of the 'characteristic' path, and their actions are undoubtedly a malignant tumor on the socialist road.\n\nAs for his 'successor' — adopted son Li Peng, he is the very embodiment of Zhou Enlai’s political legacy. He not only inherited Zhou’s hypocrisy and conservatism but also pushed the exploitation and suppression of the working class to new heights. Li Peng’s rule was filled with contempt for the proletariat. He pushed bureaucratism to the extreme, turning state-owned enterprises into machines for exploiting workers' sweat, and these were merely new-century variations of 'Zhou Enlai’s spirit'.\n\nAnd those self-styled 'Mao leftists' are even more nauseating class traitors. They wear the cloak of Maoism while groveling before the broken legacy of Chen Yun and Zhou Enlai. They pretend to be the banner of revolution but are actually well-cared-for lapdogs of the conservative elite. They shout slogans for the Cultural Revolution but betray its core — proletarian dictatorship and class struggle. Their actions have never strayed from defending the existing order. What they yearn for is nothing more than an enhanced version of the 'birdcage economy', a society-fascist regime dressed in revolutionary garb. These 'old leftists' are nothing more than the peripheral henchmen of the conservative political group, the doormen for the new capitalist elites.\n\nThe judgment of history has already arrived. The proletarian revolution will thoroughly expose the hypocritical nature of these people, ripping apart their 'Maoist' facade. Zhou Enlai, the 'immortal man', will be revealed in front of the proletariat's historical tribunal, and the disguise of the 'birdcage economy' will be burned by the flames of revolution. Those social fascists disguised as 'Mao leftists' will have nowhere to hide. True Maoists are not servants of conservatives, nor promoters of class compromise. They are the pioneers of thorough revolution! Today’s struggle is not the end, but a new beginning."
PRC_the_Flower_of_Freedom_17: "Thoroughly Criticize Revisionism"
PRC_the_Flower_of_Freedom_17_desc: "Since 1949, this land has been trapped in the quagmire of revisionism. The so-called 'New Socialist China' is nothing more than a counterfeit 'artificial butter' — brightly colored but lacking true revolutionary substance. From the beginning of the nation’s founding, the compromise policies of 'New Democracy' laid the groundwork for the later rampant spread of revisionism. It all started with the indulgence and compromise with old forces, and the so-called 'united front' was nothing more than a revolutionary disguise for counter-revolutionary poison. It opened the door to feudal remnants and capitalist restoration, ultimately leaving an endless dilemma from an unfinished revolution.\n\nSubsequently, the increasingly authoritarian state apparatus further deviated from the core ideas of Marxism. The true liberation of the working class was rendered meaningless, replaced by new privileged classes like the 'worker nobility' and 'red aristocracy'. The unity of the proletariat was torn apart by the so-called 'bloodline theory', and the flame of revolution was suppressed into a game of power. Even those projects hailed as socialist achievements were merely tools serving the ambitions of totalitarianism. How could such a distorted path be called true socialism? It not only betrayed Marxism but also betrayed the hopes of all laboring people seeking equality and justice.\n\nNow, standing upon the ruins of history, it is an inevitable historical task to settle the debts of revisionism. We must boldly declare that, from 1949 onward, all the revisionist policies implemented in this country have been in direct contradiction to the ideals of Marxism. We no longer argue about the 'merits and demerits' of those thirty years because the so-called 'merit' and 'demerit' are merely a contest between 'bad' and 'worse'.\n\nWhat we seek is a complete revolution, a truly thorough revolution that discards the poisonous legacy of revisionism. The reckoning of the past is not for the sake of dwelling in it, but for reshaping. We must restore the essence of Marxism and let the proletariat once again grasp control of history. Abolish privileges, dismantle feudal remnants, destroy the foundations of capitalist restoration, and truly realize a society without exploitation or oppression.\n\nRevisionism has reached its end. It is no longer a bridge to the future, but a high wall blocking progress. We will use the revolutionary hammer to shatter it into pieces and pave the way for the next generation toward true socialism.\n\nThere is no half-hearted revolution, no freedom shackled by old chains. We declare war on revisionism because every inch of its land is the greatest obstacle to the establishment of true socialism. Revolution must begin by eradicating the treacherous tumors within!"
PRC_the_Flower_of_Freedom_18: "Proletarian Direct Democracy"
PRC_the_Flower_of_Freedom_18_desc: "After the dust of revisionism is swept away, the stage of history will finally make room for true proletarian democracy. We must be clear that the so-called 'People's Congress System' and 'centralized democracy' are merely the shameful cover of revisionism, tools by which power is cleverly seized from the people. The liberation of the proletariat cannot be achieved through decision-making by a few. True revolutionary democracy must return to its essence: power belongs not only to the people but must be in the hands of the people at all times and in all places.\n\nProletarian direct democracy is a social experiment that transcends all false democracies. It destroys the illusion of representative government, reclaiming power from bureaucratic institutions and privileged classes, and returning it to every worker. This democracy does not rely on high representatives but is rooted in the production frontlines, factory workshops, and rural cooperatives. Every proletarian has the right to participate in decision-making, and every policy must go through direct discussion and vote by the masses. What we will build is a society that does not rely on a 'helmsman' but one where the people collectively steer the ship.\n\nThis is a great political liberation movement, a thorough experiment to break free from the shackles of hierarchy. Local community assemblies and union meetings will replace the massive bureaucratic machines, becoming the cornerstone of national governance. Any form of personal worship or concentration of power will be seen as a betrayal of the people's democracy. We will establish a system of rotational accountability, where any individual or group holding power can be recalled, criticized, or even removed at any time.\n\nMany will question whether such a system can function in the long term, fearing chaos and loss of control. But we must believe that when workers grasp their own destiny, they will unleash unprecedented creativity and wisdom. The lessons of the past few decades have shown that centralized power, under the name of 'unity' and 'efficiency,' only breeds oppression and corruption. True proletarian democracy is about letting the sunlight of power shine on every corner of society, leaving no dark spaces.\n\nFrom today, we will no longer seek excuses for elite rule, nor will we tolerate any rhetoric that places 'stability above all.' The direction of history is clear: proletarian direct democracy will replace all disguised 'people's democracies' and truly realize a society of equality without bureaucrats or oppression. This is not only a choice of governance but the beginning of a new social revolution."
PRC_the_Flower_of_Freedom_19: "Re-Communization"
PRC_the_Flower_of_Freedom_19_desc: "As the torch of proletarian democracy is lit, the flow of history becomes irreversible. The former people’s communes — a revolutionary attempt distorted and eventually betrayed by the old era — though flawed in our memories, was at its core a great pursuit of the proletariat’s communal ideals. Now, we will not stop halfway, but will redraw this blueprint more thoroughly and gloriously. The wave of re-communization will stir a new storm of liberation in this land long oppressed and exploited.\n\nThis time, the establishment of communes will not be driven by false 'political movements' or formal administrative orders, but will be deeply rooted in proletarian direct democracy. Each commune will be an autonomous community, the basic unit for production, distribution, and social governance. They will no longer be tools that obey superior orders, but the grand creations of the people’s creativity, the true democratic foundation built from the bottom up.\n\nRe-communization is not a replication of past failures, but a completely new social experiment. These communes will break free from the constraints of centralization, implementing economic autonomy and political self-governance. The production and distribution plans for factories, farms, and communities will be collectively decided by workers, with every worker having equal rights to speak and participate. Coordination between communes will also be achieved through consultation and representation, rather than submission to power.\n\nAt the same time, the communes will become new battlefields for cultural revolution, thoroughly eliminating feudal and capitalist remnants. Old concepts of hierarchy, patriarchal authority, and religious superstition will be uprooted, replaced by a spirit of equality and intellectual freedom. The education and propaganda within the communes will promote true ideological liberation, cultivating a new generation of revolutionary subjects."
PRC_the_Flower_of_Freedom_20: "Re-education of Public Officials"
PRC_the_Flower_of_Freedom_20_desc: "As the power structures of the old era are completely destroyed, the new proletarian democracy gradually consolidates. However, a new challenge arises: the public officials who have not yet been cleared, especially teachers, technicians, and grassroots clerks, who, though not directly involved in the old bureaucratic oppression, have inevitably been tainted by outdated ideas and habits. Whether these individuals can adapt to the new social order and how they will transform has become a key issue in advancing our comprehensive revolution.\n\nThe re-education movement has emerged in response. We must not only transform them ideologically but also, through the baptism of labor practice, integrate them into the actual life of the proletariat. Every public official must regularly work in factories, fields, and communities, experiencing the hardships and honor of labor first-hand.\n\nMeanwhile, we will implement a strict screening mechanism to eliminate those stubborn individuals who cannot shed their old ways of thinking and refuse to accept re-education. The new state apparatus must be a machine for the proletariat, not a patchwork of old forces’ residual toxins. Those who prove themselves through ideological transformation and practical work will continue to serve the people, while those clinging to the shadows of the old era will be discarded.\n\nMore importantly, the re-education movement is not just about individual transformation; it is a social ideological revolution. It will also drive a comprehensive revolution of the old knowledge system, eliminating the 'academic supremacy' ideas that serve authority, and ensuring that education and technology truly serve the interests of the proletariat. We will establish new curricula and knowledge structures to cultivate a thoroughly revolutionary new generation."
PRC_the_Flower_of_Freedom_21: "Rural Autonomous Communes"
PRC_the_Flower_of_Freedom_21_desc: "In the vast fields, a new revolution is sprouting. The concept of 'rural autonomous communes', centered on proletarian direct democracy, will empower grassroots workers, transforming the countryside from the periphery of state power into the starting point of self-governance from the bottom up.\n\nEach commune will become an independent unit of power, managed by a committee directly elected by local workers, truly realizing 'we do our own affairs'. These communes will not only take on the functions of production, distribution, and education but will also shoulder the responsibility for cultural development and ideological propagation, completely eliminating feudal remnants and shaping a socialist new countryside. Meanwhile, the central government will no longer control the countryside through a cumbersome bureaucratic system, but will connect directly with the people through the commune network, fully realizing the promise that 'power belongs to the people'.\n\nMore importantly, the autonomous commune is not just a governance model but a revolution against the old rural economic and social structure. It will break free from the single peasant economy model by combining collectivization with mechanization; through the establishment of local resource-sharing networks, it will enable efficient cooperation within the communes. We will also promote the flow of knowledge into the countryside, liberating commune members from both cultural and technical poverty, making the countryside a new high ground for creativity and revolutionary spirit."
PRC_the_Flower_of_Freedom_22: "Urban Autonomous Committees"
PRC_the_Flower_of_Freedom_22_desc: "The city is the most complex and intense battlefield for class struggle; here, the shadow of power is more pronounced, and the embers of capitalism burn more fiercely. To completely uproot the foundation of capitalism and realize true direct democracy for the people, we must liberate the cities from the old power networks. The establishment of urban autonomous committees is designed to reshape the role of the proletariat in the cities, completely changing the old pattern of 'people serving the city', and making the city a public tool that serves the people.\n\nEach urban autonomous committee will be directly elected by local workers, employees, and other laborers, replacing the previous bureaucratic institutions. The committee will become the highest decision-making body, responsible for managing public affairs, formulating production plans, and allocating resources reasonably. This model will break the previous concentration of administrative power in the hands of a few and return power to all workers. The committee will not only be a governance body but also the hub of a mass movement, mobilizing the people to jointly build a new urban order.\n\nA core task of the urban autonomous committees is to clear out the capitalist ghosts still hidden in the cities. Whether it is exploitative economic organizations or cultural remnants of the old order, they will all be uprooted in the wave of urban autonomy. The committees will also integrate urban resources and labor forces, promoting comprehensive cooperation among factories, schools, and public services to ensure every laborer can equally participate in the building and management of the city.\n\nThis autonomous model is not a spontaneous revolution but will be carried out in an organized way through a unified proletarian program. We will mobilize all available propaganda tools and educational resources to lay the ideological foundation for the establishment of the autonomous committees. Through revolutionary re-education, we will make every urban laborer realize that power is not an unattainable tower, but a tool they can master themselves.\n\nThe urban autonomous committees are not just a revolutionary innovation in social governance but a test of the proletarian democratic concept. They represent the most thorough transformation of class power and signify the end of the old urban model. Through these committees, laborers will no longer be the appendages of urban development but the true masters of the cities; the cities will no longer be bastions of capitalist rule, but the laboratories of a socialist future. This is a bold attempt, but it carries the hope of liberating all humanity."
PRC_the_Flower_of_Freedom_23: "Smash the Public Security, Prosecution, and Judicial Systems"
PRC_the_Flower_of_Freedom_23_desc: "The Public Security Bureau, Procuratorate, and Courts were once seen as pillars for maintaining 'social order' under the old regime, but whose order were they really maintaining? The answer is clear: these institutions have long acted as the henchmen of the ruling class, serving the interests of the exploiters, oppressing the working people, and suppressing revolutionary forces. Now, standing at a new historical turning point, we must fundamentally destroy these rotten tools of power and lay the foundation for establishing true proletarian justice.\n\nThis is a revolution to liberate justice. The traditional judicial system is essentially a coercive machine against the proletariat, defending oppression in the name of 'law' and excusing privilege in the name of 'justice'. We must utterly destroy these institutions and push them, as symbols of class oppression, into the grave of history. Any form of feudal authoritarianism, capitalist plunder, and bureaucratic sham will be thoroughly exposed in this campaign, revealing their ugly true face.\n\nAt the same time, we will establish a new social justice system, centered on public supervision and collective participation. The old courts will be replaced by people’s trials, where judgment will no longer be the control of a few over the many, but an open, fair dialogue and decision-making among all workers. The public security institutions will be reorganized into community security committees, directly managed by the working people, ensuring that all actions are aimed at protecting the interests of the masses. The prosecution system will cease to exist, and its functions will be replaced by collective discussion and supervision from proletarian self-governing institutions.\n\nTrue order comes from the unity of the people, not from the suppression of power; true justice comes from the awakening of the masses, not from the dictates of authority. Those 'orders' maintained by fear are nothing more than the noose used by the ruling class to strangle the oppressed. Instead, a new form of social self-governance will emerge—one based on mutual respect, collective cooperation, and the interests of the proletariat.\n\nThis struggle will shatter the shackles of the old order and give the people true power to manage society. Ultimately, we will usher in a new era free from oppression and fear, where true equality and justice are restored with the dignity they deserve."

Proletarian direct democracy is now rooted in rural communes and urban committees, while the power systems of the old public security, prosecution, and judicial apparatus have become rubble. However, this is just the beginning of the great revolutionary journey. The establishment of the Chinese People's Commune will mark a new dimension in the class struggle, laying the unshakable foundation for a true proletarian state.\n\nThe Chinese People’s Commune is not just a change of name, but a complete overthrow of existing social relations. It carries the hopes of all laborers and symbolizes true democracy liberated from exploitation. The commune is not centered around power, but rooted in collective self-governance; it does not rely on oppression but is based on the creed of equality. Every worker will directly participate in governance, becoming the master of the land rather than a mere spectator.\n\nThe enemies of the revolution will not quietly retreat. The reactionary forces hiding deep within society remain poised to strike. Therefore, the establishment of the Chinese People’s Commune is not just a victory for the laborers but the beginning of a new stage in the class struggle. We must remain vigilant against the resurgence of revisionism and thoroughly crush any counter-revolutionary conspiracies under the supervision of people’s democracy.\n\nToday, we declare to the world: no exploitation, no privilege, no arrogance of power. The Chinese People’s Commune is born. This new social form will become the beacon of proletarian liberation, inspiring oppressed people worldwide to fight for their future.

The AI system processes massive data flows, automatically categorizing similar or complementary opinions, logically sorting conflicts, and conducting theoretical verification to ensure the scientificity of decisions and the purity of thought.\n\nThe era of individual leadership centered on power has completely exited the stage of history. In its place is the high application of collective intelligence and the full domination of proletarian consciousness. In this model, the traditional corruption, class oppression, and bureaucratism have lost their foundation for survival, because power is no longer in the hands of individuals or small groups, but distributed among every ordinary worker, and its fairness and transparency are ensured by science and technology.\n\nThe National People's Congress is the most thorough practice of the Marxist-Leninist-Maoist ideal of 'the people being the masters of the country.' It not only returns politics to the people but also greatly improves the efficiency and quality of people's decision-making through digital tools. In this new system, every worker becomes a builder and leader of the country, and every step forward by the nation becomes a brilliant footnote of collective will.\n\nAn era belonging to all humanity, a great era that truly realizes the liberation, equality, and wisdom of the people, has arrived!"

The traditional centralized planned economy, criticized for its bureaucratization and inefficiency, has been reconsidered by history. Meanwhile, the market economy, in overcorrecting, has deviated from the fundamental goals of socialism, allowing the unchecked expansion of capital to tear apart the fabric of social justice. We must surpass both of these models and forge an unprecedented new path—localized automated planned economy.\n\nUnder this system, economic decision-making power will be given to local communes elected through direct democracy, backed by comprehensive automated production systems. With the help of AI for computation and optimization, local communes can tailor plans that suit their regional resources, labor distribution, and technological level, avoiding the one-size-fits-all pitfalls of the past. This decentralized planned economy not only reduces resource waste but also sparks innovative potential within each region under the socialist framework.\n\nThis model emphasizes the socialized application of technology. Automated production lines will be embedded in every community, every farm, and every factory to reduce human labor intensity and eliminate unemployment. Blockchain technology will be used to ensure the transparency of the planned economy’s operations, eliminating bureaucratic issues caused by information monopolies in the past. Every production index and distribution data will be made public to all people, forming a social and economic network that can be monitored by everyone.\n\nThe 'localized automated planned economy' is a thorough transformation of socialist economic management principles. It rejects both the alienation of human nature brought by capitalist markets and the rigidity of the planned economy under central bureaucratic rule. It entrusts the future of the socialist economy to the collective wisdom of workers and the power of technology, building an efficient, equal, and transparent economic system.

They will not only be cradles for technological innovation but also symbols of proletarian wisdom and strength.\n\nThese research centers will be distributed across the country, directly led by local communes and serving the local needs while maintaining close coordination with the national research network. Each center will set its research direction based on regional resource endowments and economic needs. The research centers across the country will be linked through networks, forming a powerful collective intelligence system to avoid resource duplication and maximize knowledge sharing.\n\nThe operation of Commune Research Centers adheres to one core principle: scientific research serves the people, not the pursuit of capital. There will be no privatized laboratories or patent barriers, and all research findings will be disseminated as public knowledge, promoting collective progress across society. AI will fully assist in scientific research, from data collection and analysis to experiment design optimization, liberating human scientists to focus on creative work.\n\nAdditionally, these centers will take on educational functions. Scientific education will be integrated into every link of production and research, allowing ordinary workers to deeply participate in scientific activities and become direct creators of knowledge.

Today, we stand on the reborn land, and we can now uncompromisingly carry out a true revolution to completely eliminate these social cancers!\n\nThis is not just a simple political purge, but a complete ideological and class struggle. The historical regret of the Cultural Revolution was that it did not address the root causes, did not carry out enough 'armed struggle'. It failed to truly eradicate the corruption and decay, and did not destroy the corrupt individuals who, in the name of the Party, infringed upon the people's interests. However, today, we are no longer gentle, no longer compromising—this revolution will be thorough and merciless.\n\nWe must reckon with those Communist Party cadres who once sat at the top of power, fabricating countless 'revolutionary' discourses, oppressing the people, and seizing wealth. They have no flame of revolution in them, only false masks and evil faces. We will knock them down from their thrones of power, destroy their reputations and influence, and dismantle the false power pyramids they built.\n\nAll cadres who have been corrupted by the old system will have nowhere to hide. We will use public trials, people's supervision, and digital democracy to fully expose their crimes.

However, this vast and complex country must rebuild its future in a more cautious and pragmatic way.\n\nTherefore, we must recognize clearly that while the revolution has been completed, the responsibility for restoring order and stability remains heavy. For those cadres who once held high positions, we should not completely annihilate them, nor should we let violence and hatred dominate our actions. The best solution is 'lenient treatment'. Let the majority of cadres relinquish their positions and shed the heavy shackles of oppression on the people, sending them away from the center of power, and giving them the status of ordinary citizens once again. Only in this way can we truly calm social panic and turmoil and restore the normal operation of the country.\n\nHowever, for a few individuals who can still 'be observed' and have the potential to reform, we should not totally reject them. Some may continue to serve in positions, provided they do not violate our revolutionary principles. After all, the administrative system of this country is vast, and its complex social structure requires us to show wisdom and patience when handling these matters. The victory of the revolution does not mean that all forces can be rebuilt in an instant; it means that, through continuous adjustment, we must embrace those willing to conform to the new order with the widest heart.\n\nThe wheel of history will not retreat due to isolated violence, and we must avoid falling into the trap of pure revenge. We will, through clever means, gradually guide those who were once corrupted into self-reflection and self-reformation, rebuilding a new political culture and social structure.

Whether in the jungles of Latin America, the deserts of Africa, the factories of Western Europe, or the fields of South Asia, those who hold revolutionary ideals will unite under our call, forming an unstoppable torrent. We will organize international conferences, draft new programs, discard all opportunism and compromise, and raise the banner of communism high.\n\nA global revolutionary climax is coming! The capitalist world is heading toward its demise, and the stronghold of imperialism is already trembling. We bear the mission given by history, pushing this world revolution to unprecedented heights. The brilliance of Marxism will shine in every corner of the oppressed world, and the proletariat's united front will redefine the future of this old world!\n\nThis is a new beginning, the echo of history, and the loudest answer to those revolutionaries who once failed! Long live internationalism! Long live the global revolution!"
PRC_masters_of_asia_9: "Coordinate with Our Comrades in Mexico"
PRC_masters_of_asia_9_desc: "As the gunfire of the Mexican Civil War fades, the newly born Zapatista government rises like a phoenix reborn from the flames, standing firm on the American continent with radical indigenous autonomy and socialist ideals. Yet, the victory of the revolution is not an end but the beginning of a new journey. While the Zapatista National Liberation Army has merged Marxism, anarchism, and liberation theology in practice, there still remain impure elements within its ranks—such as Catholic liberation theology's conservative forces and the remnants of 'agricultural socialism' with a limited understanding of scientific socialism.\n\nAs part of the international revolutionary family, our responsibility is not only to celebrate their victory but also to provide strong assistance and guidance for this unfinished social revolution. We will send delegations to Mexico to provide economic support and technical assistance, help rebuild the war-torn country, and reorganize their internal forces, ensuring that their revolutionary path remains aligned with the core spirit of Marxism-Leninism.\n\nThe great victory of the Mexican revolution will prove to us that, whether new Zapatistas or other revolutionaries, as long as they adhere to the core of scientific socialism, they can cross cultural and historical divides and march together toward the brilliant future of proletarian liberation.\n\n§R The unity of internationalism knows no bounds! The revolutionary spark in the Americas will spread to every corner of the world!§!"
PRC_masters_of_asia_10: "Coordinate with Our Comrades in South Africa"
PRC_masters_of_asia_10_desc: "As the smoke of the South African revolution slowly clears, a new African communist dawn is rising on the horizon. This land, long plagued by oppression and plunder, is now bearing the fruits of revolution. The victory in South Africa is not only a milestone in the African people's struggle for liberation but also a new hope for the world proletarian movement. In the sound of victory's trumpet, the Pan-African Alliance has emerged, injecting unprecedented strength into the communist cause across Africa.\n\nHowever, like any great revolutionary practice, this glorious beginning faces numerous challenges. The complex ethnic, cultural, and historical issues of the African continent, along with the lingering poisons of colonialism, place an enormous responsibility on the comrades in South Africa. As the global vanguard of the proletariat, we must act swiftly, side by side with our comrades in South Africa, to support this promising communist experiment and lay a solid foundation for the victory of the revolution.\n\nWe will mobilize ICOR’s resources, from financial aid to technical support, and share theoretical experience to provide comprehensive assistance to the Pan-African Alliance. This is not only material support but also ideological leadership. By integrating the wisdom of revolutionaries worldwide, we will help South Africa establish a modern socialist economy, break the chains of colonial capitalism, and assist the Pan-African Alliance in spreading revolutionary ideas across Africa, uniting more nations and peoples in the anti-imperialist struggle. We will also guide comrades in managing inter-ethnic relations to prevent any divisive forces that could undermine unity.\n\nThe revolutionary storm in Africa has already risen, and the red flag will fly between the Horn of Africa and the Cape of Good Hope. From Cape Town to Cairo, from Kinshasa to Algiers, the power of communism is about to take shape on this vast continent. We believe that South Africa’s success will become a crucial chapter in the global proletarian movement, and the Pan-African Alliance’s banner will light the path for the struggles of the world.\n\n§R International solidarity is invaluable, and Africa's revolution will become the new pinnacle of human liberation!§!"
PRC_masters_of_asia_11: "Coordinate with Our Comrades in Central Africa"
PRC_masters_of_asia_11_desc: "Although the smoke of the civil war in Congo has dissipated, the flames of revolution have not been extinguished. Central Africa, a land long oppressed and exploited, now welcomes the birth of new hope. With the establishment of the Central African Republic, the proletariat of the African interior has, for the first time, truly taken control of its own destiny. However, the victory of the revolution is just the beginning, and the real challenges are only starting. Poverty, famine, disease, and the deep shackles left by colonialism are still the harsh realities that this new socialist state must face.\n\nIn the face of these difficulties, we cannot stand idly by. The victory in Central Africa is not only a victory for the Central African people; it is an important milestone in the global struggle of the proletariat. As part of the global socialist camp, we have the responsibility and duty to ensure that the revolutionary flower in this land grows strong. ICOR will mobilize global power to provide comprehensive support for Central Africa in areas such as economy, politics, technology, education, and talent.\n\nEconomically, we will send experts to help develop an economic blueprint that balances automation and equitable distribution, freeing the country from the colonial economic structure of single-export dependence. In agriculture, we will assist in promoting advanced mechanized production technology to ensure food security and establish a sustainable ecological agricultural system. In education, we will cultivate a large number of red intellectuals to form a strong proletarian technical team in Central Africa. Culturally, we will help them eradicate the remnants of colonialist thought and reestablish the core values of socialism.\n\nAt the same time, comrades in Central Africa will need to solidify the newly formed regime politically. We will assist in improving grassroots democratic mechanisms, ensuring that the people truly hold power over the governance of the nation. Any reactionary conspiracies, whether external interventions or internal sabotage, will be ruthlessly crushed.\n\nThis is not only assistance to Central Africa but also a great practice of internationalism. The success of Central Africa will serve as a model for oppressed nations around the world, proving that socialism is not only an ideal in theory but the key to solving practical problems. Today, we stand behind the people of Central Africa, and tomorrow, their flag will fly high alongside ours in the global revolutionary wave.\n\n§R The liberation of Central Africa is the starting point of a new chapter for the African continent, and international solidarity will ignite a new hope in human history!§!"
PRC_masters_of_asia_12: "Coordinate with Our Comrades in Central America"
PRC_masters_of_asia_12_desc: "In the long river of history across the American continent, the unified dream of the people of Central America has finally emerged from the turmoil. As the United States sank into civil war, this land, long oppressed and exploited by imperialism, has finally seized its own destiny. Through struggle and unity, the revolutionary forces of Central America have raised the banner of liberation, ending the era of division, corruption, and colonial remnants. Now, a unified and powerful Central America has emerged, but their path is still fraught with challenges.\n\nThe success of the Central American revolution is not only a regional victory but also another great chapter in the international proletarian cause. ICOR will seize this historic opportunity, using large-scale aid as a bond, to bring Central America into our international communist family. Financial, technical, and theoretical support will become the three pillars that will sustain the Central American liberation cause. We will inject new vitality into this tropical rainforest and volcanic land, making it an important force in the global socialist camp.\n\nEconomically, we will help Central America modernize agriculture, improve food security, and break free from the dependence on a single cash crop. We will assist in establishing a new industrial system, focusing on local resources and promoting a balanced development of automation and ecological production. In education and culture, we will help the people of this land deeply understand the universal truths of Marxism-Leninism, destroy the cultural shackles of imperialism and feudal remnants, and lay the foundation for the construction of a socialist cultural system.\n\nHowever, this cause is not only about aid but also about the deep integration of beliefs. We will encourage the Central American revolutionary forces to thoroughly eliminate internal impure elements. Whether local oligarchs assimilated by the old system or revisionists who deviate from Marxism, they will be excluded from the socialist process. At the same time, we will assist in constructing a unified government based on democratic centralism, addressing existing regional conflicts.\n\nIn the future, Central America will no longer be the backyard of imperialist exploitation but will become the vanguard of proletarian internationalism. Today, we help the people of Central America lay a new foundation; tomorrow, they will join us in holding the torch of international communism and leading the bright future of the world!\n\n§R Let the fire of revolution burn in every corner of this land, and let the flag of unity fly in the skies of Latin America!§!"
PRC_masters_of_asia_13: "Promote the Unity of the African People"
PRC_masters_of_asia_13_desc: "Africa, this vast and rich continent, has long suffered from imperialist plunder, colonial oppression, and internal divisions. Even in the post-colonial era, warlords, puppet regimes, and reactionary feudal rulers still occupy the land, hindering the African people's march toward liberation. However, the dawn of a new era is rising on the horizon of this continent, and the awakening voice of the African people is gathering into an unstoppable torrent.\n\nBuilding on the revolutionary victories of our comrades in Central and South Africa, we have now entered an excellent opportunity to promote the unity of the African people. With the Pan-African Alliance as the core and socialist goals as the guiding principle, our task is not only to support revolutionary forces across Africa but also to help the people of this land completely break the shackles of warlordism, eliminate imperialist puppets, and overthrow the reactionary feudal rulers who seek to restore the old order. The unity and freedom of the African people can no longer be constrained by these destructive forces.\n\nWe will provide comprehensive support for the African continent through the framework of international communism: economic resource infusion, sharing revolutionary experiences, military guidance, and cultural unity propaganda. Every step will strengthen cooperation among African countries, building a truly independent and socialist nation-state alliance. Based on this, we will also vigorously promote cross-border national cooperation and push for the establishment of a united governance model for the African continent, breaking the divisive patterns left by colonial borders.\n\nThe African people's cause belongs not only to Africa but to all of humanity. By overthrowing reactionary forces and achieving the socialist unity of Africa, we will inject new vitality into the global revolutionary struggle and demonstrate the great power of people-led destiny. This great undertaking is the loudest rebuke to imperialism and the most profound tribute to the future of socialism."
