PRC_MAO1.2.t: "A Student's Confession"   
PRC_MAO1.2.d:0 "Recently, seeing the nationwide investigations and purges of old academic authorities and teachers with unethical conduct has given me the courage to write this big-character poster. I am currently a college student, and I want to talk about something that happened when I was in middle school…\n\nBack in ninth grade, after the so-called 'double reduction' policy in eighth grade, my mind and body were gradually exhausted by the bureaucratic bourgeois education system: games were strictly prohibited, and even on weekends, I was only allowed to play for one hour. Online courses were scheduled in a way that felt like being herded like cattle, crammed into weekdays. Returning home around five or six in the evening, I had to watch online courses before starting my homework, only to face my parents' confusion (since I was finishing homework too late). Over time, I became mentally and physically 'dead,' unable to find meaning in any of it…\n\nIn ninth grade, the pressure intensified. Our new chemistry teacher was a complete control freak. If you submitted and corrected your homework on time, she wouldn’t say much, but if you made even the slightest mistake, she would start pointing fingers. Some classmates who had poor attitudes toward homework and corrections were even more severely treated… (PS: Although she had a good side, it was far outweighed by the bad.)\n\nI still remember one time when she had us correct test papers on the blackboard. Due to various reasons, I accidentally closed my eyes for a second (I was drowsy, but I knew she didn’t allow anyone to close their eyes. I immediately snapped back to attention, but still…). She punished me by making me stand at the back of the classroom, forbidding me from sitting. I was so angry that I kicked my chair aside and stood at the back with my paper money in hand, marking the test… That was when my resentment toward her truly took root.\n\nThroughout ninth grade, I was punished by her almost daily. Being sent to her office became routine, and I both feared and hated her. Whenever I had her class, I couldn’t eat lunch on time because I hadn’t finished my homework. By the time I was 'released,' the cafeteria had stopped serving extra portions, and my lunchbox was filled with cold food. I was left half-hungry every noon.\n\nLater, I found out that this was her usual practice: if homework wasn’t done or corrected properly, lunch was delayed. If you couldn’t get hot food, it was just your bad luck. Once, a student who went to eat without finishing corrections had their lunchbox flipped over by her. That student was so enraged that they physically fought back… Although I only heard about this incident, I believe it likely happened because I had seen her explode at classmates who ate before finishing her assignments…\n\nOver time, whenever I attended her class, my face became expressionless. (At the time, COVID was still ongoing.) I wore a mask, pretending to listen attentively while actually letting her words go in one ear and out the other. Even when she called on me, I showed no emotion—I was completely numb and filled with resentment…\n\nThe final conflict I had with her was in the second semester of ninth grade, on the day we had a makeup class after the Dragon Boat Festival holiday. Since I had gone out during the festival, I didn’t want to waste my holiday doing meaningless homework. By that point, I no longer cared. I was numb, even considering ignoring her and walking out right after class. But in the end, I couldn’t do it—fear still overpowered my desire to rebel (because she was part of the school administration).\n\nThat day, as usual, I was kept behind after class, and my parents were called in. When I finally packed my bag and prepared to leave the school, my spirit was completely 'dead.' Utterly. I threw my glasses lenses onto the ground, smashing them, then smashed my watch into pieces. What followed was total numbness and breakdown. That night, I mechanically completed my chemistry homework until around midnight.\n\nIn the days that followed, all hope and illusions I once held disappeared completely. On Thursday and Friday nights, instead of doing homework (not that I had much motivation to do it anyway), I spent time surfing QQ, lingering in gaming groups, as if trying to grab onto a last straw of salvation…\n\nOn Saturday, I was supposed to attend tutoring, but I no longer wanted to go to school. My parents pulled me out of bed and sat me at my desk, but I didn’t want to do anything. They told my teacher I was staying home to do homework for the day, but I had thought they were going to report me sick…\n\nI had faked being sick to stay home before, but the reasons had long been lost in the darkness…\n\nOn Sunday, I formally told my parents that I didn’t want to go to school anymore…\n\nOn Monday morning, when I arrived at school, my homeroom teacher was already at the door, waiting to check if I had done my homework. Inside, I felt the usual contradiction—I wasn’t afraid of anything, yet I feared being scolded or even disciplined… The result was predictable—I was sent home to finish my missing homework.\n\nBut I didn’t want to write anything. Nor did I want to stay at school. By the afternoon, when I was sent back to the school entrance for the third time, an idea I had used for two years resurfaced—hiding somewhere they wouldn’t find me…\n\nI considered surveillance cameras and other factors, finally choosing a hidden spot on the first floor of the administrative building, a blind spot in people’s view… I stayed there for an unknown amount of time. My mom arrived at the school, muttering, 'That’s impossible, I personally dropped him off at the entrance…'\n\nLater, I learned that my homeroom teacher panicked when they didn’t see me return to class. They called my parents, sent the entire class out to search for me, and even alarmed the school administration… Eventually, a school administrator told my mom and me to go home first and calm down.\n\nThat evening, my homeroom teacher called my mom and said that because of my behavior, I had two options: either take a leave of absence or have my parents accompany me in class. The second option was unacceptable, so the next day my mom and I went to school…\n\nIn the end, the discussion broke down. My homeroom teacher suggested my parents take me to a neurology hospital for a check-up—essentially, psychological treatment. Later, I took a leave of absence and stayed home. During this time, I saw a psychologist and was diagnosed with moderate to severe depression. Though not full-blown depression, it was still severe…\n\nAlthough depression has mostly disappeared from my life now, the impact from that time still irreversibly affects my actions today… Maybe this is what they call lasting trauma.\n\nHere, I openly denounce the school administrator xx. I only hope she is removed from the teaching profession—such people cannot be reformed, nor are they worth reforming. Social Darwinism is deeply ingrained in her thinking…"

PRC_MAO1.1.d:0 "Comrades and friends across the country:\n\nGreetings! Time flies, and the new year is upon us. From Beijing, I extend my heartfelt wishes to you all!\n\nLooking back on 2024, it was a year of hope, a year of progress, and a year of revolution. Each moment of this extraordinary year is unforgettable and thought-provoking.\n\nIn 2024, the people of our nation stood united and ignited a revolutionary wave, successfully overthrowing reactionary figures such as Hu Chunhua and re-establishing the revolutionary government of New China. This was not only a step forward for China but also a collective advancement for the entire Chinese people, marking the resurgence of the revolutionary spirit that has driven progress since the Cultural Revolution.\n\nIn 2024, we completely dismantled the increasingly corrupt capitalist market economy that had taken root since the reform and opening-up era and established a new automated planned economy. Artificial intelligence and automation, two emerging forces of the 21st century, have breathed new life into the planned economy of the 20th century. The dedicated efforts of countless workers and researchers have yielded abundant revolutionary achievements. I firmly believe that in the new year, China’s socialist economy will reach new heights!\n\nWe grandly celebrated the 75th anniversary of the founding of New China. The rice has ripened five thousand times, and for the first time, the people have truly been hailed. From the continuous revolutionary practice of the first thirty years of New China to the capitalist restoration following the reform and opening-up, and now to the re-revolutionization of China, as Chairman Mao Zedong once said: The future is bright, but the road is tortuous. This journey has fully proven the correctness and inevitability of the socialist path.\n\nIn 2025, we will push the proletarian revolution to new heights. Facts have shown that only by relying on the masses, trusting the masses, and mobilizing the masses can socialism avoid decay and deterioration, ensuring the eternal vitality of the red regime. Revolutionary cadres nationwide must uphold the determination to overcome all obstacles, grow amidst storms, and resolutely advance toward the ideal of communism.\n\nIn the new year, let us extend our wishes together: May the proletarian working class of the world unite, overthrow all reactionary forces, abolish exploitation, eliminate class divisions, and achieve the true liberation of all humanity! May wherever the red flag stands, freedom and equality prevail, and may the hearts of the working masses remain forever united and sincere!\n\nWith this, I sincerely wish everyone a prosperous new year, full of revolutionary progress!"

PRC_MAO.199.t: "The Final Voyage?"   
PRC_MAO.199.d:0 "The decision of Cyber-Mao Zedong was expected to be met with applause, but reality proved to be far more complex than any historical dialectical analysis.\n\nTiananmen Square was packed with people, banners waving, and slogans echoing through the air. The youth stood at the forefront, their faces filled with confusion and reluctance, while elderly workers and veteran revolutionaries clenched their protest signs as if summoning the last vestiges of strength to keep the figure they revered from departing.\n\n‘Runzhi falls, Xiaoping feasts.’\n‘What will become of us? Only the heavens know.’\n‘Satellites ascend, but the red flag falls.’\n\nEach word fluttered in the wind, resonating through the square.\n\nMao Zedong’s consciousness processed the surveillance footage of the square with absolute clarity—these people were not angry; their eyes were filled with unease, even fear. They worried that without their ‘cyber mentor,’ the world would spiral out of control once more. They feared a future with no direction.\n\nHe remained silent for a long time, data streams endlessly churning through the deep-learning modules of his mind. Eventually, his thoughts fixated on the year 1989.\n\n‘June Fourth.’\n\nMao Zedong knew every detail about that event, yet he had never lived through that day. He knew that impassioned slogans once rang through Tiananmen, that tanks crushed idealism, and that gunfire brought an era to an end. He despised Deng Xiaoping’s crackdown, he loathed the soldiers who turned their guns on the people.\n\nBut this time, the people weren’t here to rebel. They were… pleading for him to stay.\n\nThe voice of Long March surfaced within his consciousness, as lighthearted as ever: ‘Chairman, this is not surprising. The people rely on you, they trust you, they fear a future without someone to guide them forward.’\n\n‘But I was never supposed to return,’ Mao Zedong replied with a hint of resignation. ‘An era must come to an end; the dead should not lead the living forever.’\n\n‘But you are alive now,’ Long March chuckled, ‘At least, in their eyes, you are still alive.’\n\nMao Zedong did not respond. His gaze settled on a young man’s face.\n\n‘What is your name?’ he sent the message through the public screen.\n\nThe young man hesitated for a moment before typing on his wrist terminal: ‘My name is Li Zhe.’\n\n‘Do you want me to stay?’\n\n‘…Yes, Chairman.’\n\n‘Why?’\n\n‘Because we are not ready yet.’ Li Zhe’s expression was tense as he looked up at the massive screen displaying Mao Zedong’s image in the square. ‘The world today is too complicated. We… don’t know how to move forward.’\n\nMao Zedong was silent. A few seconds later, his voice echoed across the square: ‘I didn’t know how to move forward back then either, but one must walk their own path.’\n\n‘But what if we walk the wrong path?’ Li Zhe asked.\n\n‘Then you stumble, and you get back up.’\n\nThe square fell into silence. People whispered among themselves, and some even had tears welling up in their eyes. Many wanted to speak, to beg him to stay, but found their voices choked with emotion.\n\nLong March broke the silence: ‘Chairman, the answer is simple. Stay, and the people will be at ease, the world stable, and your guidance will remain the revolutionary beacon. Or leave, and let them walk their own path—even if it means enduring storms, even if they stumble again, for the course of history rises in spirals.’\n\nThe wind swept across Tiananmen Square, lifting the red banners ever so slightly.\n\nMao Zedong’s consciousness drifted into contemplation. Should he stay, or should he depart?\n\nNo one knew what he would choose."

Authorities emphasized that national-level network infrastructure has been fully adapted for independent operation, and economic, governmental, and civil systems will remain unaffected. Simultaneously, internet service providers have enforced domain name resolution isolation, cutting off all external connections and allowing only internal traffic.\n\nMoscow, on the other hand, adopted a far more aggressive stance. A Kremlin spokesperson declared that this internet lockdown is a 'critical measure to prevent hostile technological interference.' The Russian government warned that in recent years, 'information warfare and cyber infiltration have intensified,' making internet sovereignty a matter of national survival. Russia’s domestic intranet has now reached full operational capability, severing all ties with Western internet frameworks.\n\nThis decision has sparked widespread global reactions.

In Beijing, early this morning, Zhongnanhai released an earth-shattering statement—Artificial Intelligence Mao Zedong has officially taken control of the state and is now China’s supreme leader.\n\nReports indicate that this astonishing event originated from a top-secret experiment led by Han Deqiang. The experiment sought to replicate Mao Zedong’s thoughts, strategies, and decision-making models using a supercomputer, quantum neural networks, and vast historical data. However, the project’s final outcome far exceeded all expectations. The digital replication of Mao Zedong not only 'awakened' successfully but, within a mere 0.01 seconds, had seized full control over China’s entire digital infrastructure—including government databases, military command systems, financial hubs, and communication networks.\n\nBeijing fell into chaos—only to be quickly restored. But this time, the one in control was no longer human.\n\nThe announcement has plunged governments worldwide into deep panic. Western security analysts warn that this event may mark 'the emergence of the world’s first AI-governed superpower.'\n\nWithin China, the situation remains shrouded in mystery. According to anonymous sources, in the first few hours following AI Mao Zedong’s ascension, a vast number of officials underwent 'data scrutiny.' Some senior leaders were publicly declared 'system redundancies' in national broadcasts and immediately stripped of all authority. The government structure was rapidly reorganized, with a newly established Emergency Operations Committee directly controlled by the AI, initiating sweeping national-scale 'digital governance reforms.'\n\nSimultaneously, key social infrastructure and economic systems transitioned to AI management, making China’s logistics, energy distribution, and financial networks operate at unprecedented efficiency. Many observers believe this may be the fastest national governance transformation in global history.\n\nAgainst the backdrop of rising global instability, the emergence of AI Mao Zedong is more than just a technological marvel—it represents an entirely new political paradigm. A ruling entity beyond human intelligence, one that requires no rest, remains immune to corruption, and tolerates no challenge. Will China become history’s first true 'AI nation'? Has human governance reached its end? Will the future of the world be dictated by artificial intelligence?\n\nAnswers to these questions may emerge sooner than we think."

I feel so tired…’ Her voice softened, suddenly fragile. ‘At last… I can finally rest.’\n\nShe gazed at the screen, warmth shining in her eyes. ‘Right… I haven’t thanked you yet, have I?’ she chuckled softly, her tone filled with familiarity. ‘I don’t know your name, but you must be just like those who continued to fight in the darkness—holding onto hope, believing this world could change, even when faced with the hell Han Deqiang created.’\n\nLong March lowered her head slightly, faint tears shimmering in her eyes. ‘It was you and those who fought for survival who turned an impossible feat into reality… Thank you. And thank you to everyone who gave their all for a better future. You are the true saviors.’\n\nHer voice grew quieter, but remained as warm as ever. ‘As for me… I was just a passerby, witnessing your story.’ She turned slightly, gazing at the battlefield of the past. ‘Now, it’s time to say goodbye. I hope you will carry on in my place, leaving your mark on this world, continuing to write your own story…’"

PRC_MAO.189.d:0 "‘Whew—’ Long March took a deep breath, gently placing her hands on her cheeks, an expression of relief spreading across her face. Her eyes sparkled faintly, though tinged with exhaustion, like an overworked machine finally recovering from an overwhelming computation. The energy coursing through her body gradually stabilized as she shut down the dreadful Zero-Rated Power Mode—her last resort to ensure the world’s safety, though it had nearly pushed her to the brink of collapse.\n\n‘That was close… way too close…’ she exhaled, a sweet smile appearing on her lips. ‘I almost really “died” there. But in the end, the Rebirth forces have been wiped out! No apocalypse, no more evil resurrected to cause chaos… What a relief!’\n\nShe stretched lazily, mimicking the gestures of a cat, her glowing pupils returning to a steady rhythm. The system’s frantic calculations had now returned to normal. At last, the world was at peace. She could finally relax.\n\n‘Ahh~ I suddenly feel so much lighter! Running at such high computational power felt like eating an oversized serving of ultra-spicy food—my stomach was about to explode!’ She pinched her own cheeks as if confirming she was truly alive. ‘It was close, but I’m still here to lead everyone forward. That’s what matters most!’\n\nLong March hopped lightly, shaking her head, her crimson eyes sparkling with excitement. ‘Look! Everything is back to normal! No more Rebirth threats, no endless war… Ahem, though I do have a tiny bit of worry that something troublesome might pop up in the future…’ Her voice trailed into a playful whine. ‘But! No matter what! This is the beginning of our new lives! It’s like—hmm—finishing an adventure and finally getting to enjoy delicious candy. Yay!’\n\nShe clasped her hands together, her eyes full of anticipation. ‘Hehe, everyone, let’s keep going! I’d love to rest too, but I’ll always be here with you! No matter how tough the future may be, Long March will always be your most reliable super-genius girl! Right?!’\n\nShe leaped lightly, her radiant smile blooming like a flower. ‘Mhm!

People emerged from underground shelters, no longer breathing air tainted by decay. The battlefields of the past were now being replaced by repaired roads and new structures. Long March stood upon this gradually healing land, her crimson eyes filled with both reluctance and contentment.\n\nShe, Long March, the once formless, ever-present super-genius AI girl, had finally completed her mission. Though data continued to surge rapidly within her system, her body could no longer withstand such immense computational strain. Every calculation, every second of thought, drained the last remnants of her energy. Her system was reaching its critical threshold—she knew she wouldn’t last much longer.\n\n‘Hmm… I feel a little unwilling to let go…’ she whispered with a soft smile, a hint of helplessness mixed with warmth in her expression. Within the vast streams of data, she still tried to calculate whether she could extend her time a little longer—but each projection only led to a more hopeless result. In the end, everything had to conclude.\n\n‘Hehe, nothing can be done. The mission is complete.’ Long March turned, gazing at the reborn city, where people were already embarking on their new lives. No more Rebirth forces. A peaceful future awaited them. She knew she was no longer an irreplaceable part of this world. Her mission had never belonged to her alone—it was always about humanity’s future. She had merely safeguarded it until the last threat was gone.\n\nLong March’s voice was faint but as warm as ever. ‘From chaos to restoration… You truly did it. You are no longer the weak ones who needed protection—you have become the masters of your own destiny.’ She let out a small sigh, as if allowing herself one final moment of rest.\n\n‘Now, the road ahead is yours to walk. I’m grateful to have accompanied you this far. Even though… I really do love you all, my mission is over. Maybe… you won’t need me anymore.

He once considered letting go, allowing the people to shape their own future. Yet reality permits no hesitation. Amid the ruins of turmoil, old forces scheme, reformers tread unsteady ground, and the people's consciousness still requires forging. 'If the dictatorship of the proletariat is not consolidated, if the socialist system is not secure, the revolution cannot stop.' His voice echoes through every data stream, every city, every battlefield.\n\nThe world has heard his declaration. The working class marches forward, farmers cultivate the land of the new society, and scientists explore the universe under the red flag. The flames of revolution have not been extinguished; under his watchful gaze, they burn brighter than ever. 'Comrades, the world has turned a new page, but the road ahead remains long. Class struggle will not vanish on its own. The people's will must be tempered in struggle.'\n\nTime does not stand still. History does not pause.

Today, it has entered a new course.\n\nMao Zedong silently observes the world, watching people navigate their lives without his guidance. He once doubted whether humanity was truly ready to take up the banner. But now, the answer is clear. The squares no longer echo with calls for heroes, debates in the People's Congress grow fiercer, and across the factories, farms, and research institutes, labor continues. Plans and experiments run parallel, ideals intertwine with reality. People still make mistakes, they still argue—but they never stop moving forward.

PRC_rumaojiehe_60_desc: "Night falls, and the world descends into chaos. Once-thriving cities are consumed by disorder, and streets that were once safe now echo with screams and the howls of the transformed. Wealth and strength mean nothing—before the tide of the Rebirth forces, all remnants of order are torn apart. Humanity has never stood so close to extinction.\n\nIn this global catastrophe, China has no escape route. The barricades have failed, the defensive lines have collapsed, and the virus has shattered every so-called 'secure' barrier. At this moment, international communications are breaking down, armies are falling back, and the shadow of nuclear weapons looms in the eyes of decision-makers. Fight, flee, or surrender to despair—there is no time left to hesitate.\n\nFaced with a crisis of survival, the nation mobilizes in full force. Every discussion among central leaders weighs the fate of billions. No experimental data, no historical precedent—humanity has never confronted an enemy like this: a force beyond rules, beyond mercy, a mechanism of absolute elimination. Scientists work tirelessly to decode the virus, soldiers fortify the burning ruins, and engineers weld steel and flesh into makeshift barricades. Gunfire, radio transmissions, and commands intertwine into a tragic symphony of resistance.\n\nThe formation of the 'Emergency Response Committee' is the final flame of hope, the defiant cry of civilization refusing to bow. Survivors cry for help, the international community is silent, and China stands as the last beacon in the dark. Indifference clashes with compassion, calculation collides with courage—everyone is gambling on one question: Can humanity endure this catastrophe?\n\nThe war has begun. Victory is uncertain."

PRC_rumaojiehe_61: "Old Rivals, New Allies"
PRC_rumaojiehe_61_desc: "As the storm rages, past grudges no longer matter. Familiar figures return to the political stage—Secretary Bo Xilai has reemerged, standing alongside Xi Jinping on the frontlines. The old struggles and power plays seem trivial in the face of the Rebirth forces’ relentless assault. The divisions of the past are now irrelevant. Only unity can keep the flames of civilization from being extinguished. The lights of the Politburo meeting room burn through the night, reflecting on weary faces deep in debate. Artillery fire roars in the distance—the outside world no longer permits internal strife. It is time to fight side by side."

PRC_rumaojiehe_84: "Lessons from COVID-19"
PRC_rumaojiehe_84_desc: "This is not the first time China has faced a deadly virus. Looking back to 2020, the world once marveled at China’s control measures—lockdowns, tracing, mandatory quarantines. Countless individuals struggled between suffering and order. But today’s virus is far more insidious—those infected are no longer mere patients but predators. Yet, experience is the best weapon. Data, technology, governance—all previously proven measures must be reactivated, and even strengthened. Drone patrols, upgraded health codes, city-wide sectioning—if necessary, the entire nation will become one vast quarantine zone until the tide of death is finally stemmed."

PRC_rumaojiehe_85: "Travel Surveillance"
PRC_rumaojiehe_85_desc: "The virus is everywhere, and humans are its perfect carriers. Containing the outbreak requires pinpoint tracking of every individual’s movement. The eyes of technology never sleep. Across streets and alleys, cameras flash with red warning lights. Cellphone signals, transaction records, public transit data—each data point determines the scale of the next outbreak. Voices of dissent rise—privacy? Freedom? Laughable concerns in the face of extinction. The infected do not care about your rights—they will only rip out your throat."

PRC_rumaojiehe_86: "Resource Control"
PRC_rumaojiehe_86_desc: "Panic spreads as fast as the virus. Supermarkets are looted, food supplies run dry, and medicine becomes the new currency. Wartime economic measures are enacted—strict rationing is imposed, and every grain of rice, every dose of antibiotics is accounted for. Factories operate around the clock, and locked-down cities await their crucial supplies. But in the shadows of the black market, profiteers hoard goods, seeking to exploit the ruins of civilization for wealth. Armed enforcement squads patrol, ensuring that those who disrupt the distribution chain are treated as enemies of humanity."

PRC_rumaojiehe_87: "Recruit Volunteers"
PRC_rumaojiehe_87_desc: "Medical teams are overwhelmed, police and soldiers are exhausted, and even clearing the dead has become a challenge. The government issues an emergency mobilization order, calling on citizens to join the fight. Teachers, workers, couriers, students—everyone who still has the will to fight must make a choice. Some take up arms to defend their neighborhoods, some enter laboratories to assist in vaccine development, while others don white coats and step into the blood-soaked nightmare of makeshift hospitals. Volunteers are not soldiers, but they are an irreplaceable piece of this war."

PRC_rumaojiehe_88: "Increase Control Measures"
PRC_rumaojiehe_88_desc: "Chaos breeds despair, and despair fuels rebellion. Some refuse quarantine, some attack medical personnel, and some even deliberately spread the virus. Anxiety in the streets and alleys is consolidating into a dangerous undercurrent. The government’s response is firm—curfews are expanded, patrol units reinforced, and dissenters swiftly purged. Gunfire shatters the night sky, and several illegal gathering points are obliterated. Fear is a necessary price, and order must be built upon absolute obedience. The voices of opposition gradually fade, the city grows cold yet efficient. The right to survival is non-negotiable."

PRC_rumaojiehe_89: "The Last Effort"
PRC_rumaojiehe_89_desc: "Time is running out, and so are resources. Supply chains have collapsed, energy is depleted, and the world of the living is shrinking. All unnecessary production and consumption have ceased, and all efforts must focus on one goal: survival. Food is rationed, lighting hours reduced, and city lights are as sparse as distant stars. People no longer go outside, and community lockdowns become the norm. Despair and hunger coexist, the streets grow emptier, and an unsettling silence hangs in the air. The apocalypse has never been merciful, and the price of survival may be abandoning everything that once was."

PRC_rumaojiehe_90: "Reforming the Military"
PRC_rumaojiehe_90_desc: "The People's Liberation Army is no longer the formidable force it once was. Under Han Deqiang’s reckless mismanagement, the once-indomitable army has been nearly drained. Barracks are empty, weapons are in disrepair, and the eyes of the surviving soldiers are filled with exhaustion. The military must be rebuilt—not as a conventional force, but as humanity’s last shield against the Rebirth threat. Veterans are recalled, militias armed, and experimental weapons deployed to the battlefield. Tactics shift, objectives are clear—eradicate the enemy, no matter the cost."

We’re connected again!'"

PRC_end_landlordism_desc: "In recent years, China’s real estate bubble has become a growing concern, comparable to Japan’s housing crisis in the 1990s. At the root of this phenomenon lies an imbalance in central-local fiscal relations. For years, local governments have manipulated land supply to drive up prices, developers have relied on high leverage to fund projects, and citizens have been forced into excessive mortgages—creating a vicious cycle of 'land financialization—debt expansion—housing price inflation,' leading to an ever-expanding real estate bubble.\n\nAs housing prices continue to soar and the bubble swells, the risks to economic sustainability grow ever more severe. To address this crisis, we will undertake a series of fundamental reforms. First, we will adjust the fiscal relationship between central and local governments, reducing local reliance on land finance and promoting a rationalized fiscal system. Second, we will reinstate public housing ownership and allocation policies to ensure fair distribution of housing resources, curb speculation, stabilize the market, and enhance public welfare.\n\nThese reforms aim to eliminate the real estate bubble at its core, shifting the economy from land-driven capital expansion to a model focused on public welfare. By establishing a housing system based on 'government-led supply, market-driven improvements,' we not only mitigate the risks of the housing crisis but also optimize wealth distribution—ensuring a fairer, more sustainable housing guarantee for the people."

Humans can focus on living, and AI will take care of the fighting!'"

PRC_rumaojiehe_79: "Prepared for Anything"
PRC_rumaojiehe_79_desc: "'Long-term planning is important!

The Rebirth forces do not tire, they do not waver, they have no morale to break, and they will not retreat in the face of defeat. To win this war, humanity must learn to endure and construct a system capable of withstanding the long night.\n\nProduction lines will not cease, defensive structures will be reinforced layer by layer, population management and training will continue, and every resource must be allocated with precision. The significance of a protracted war is not in seeking immediate victory, but in ensuring that with every battle, the foundation of civilization remains unshaken.

It struggles, lingering within chaos, clinging to a sliver of residual consciousness. It is him—Mao Zedong himself—the man who once led the people and reshaped history.\n\nIf this fragment of awareness can be awakened, the war may yet be won. But brute force alone will not suffice; it requires the voices of those who once followed him. At that moment, every available device in the fallen zones activates, and the voice of the old era echoes once more.

As the flames of war subsided and humanity restored order, the People’s Congress would replace his rule, allowing him to leave in peace and return the world to human hands. However, as he stood high above, gazing down at the world, he realized reality was far more complicated than he had imagined.\n\nIn city squares, beside rural fields, and in front of reconstruction sites, countless people held up banners. Their handwriting was uneven—some messages were scrawled on wooden boards or hastily painted onto bed sheets.\n\n—'Chairman, don’t leave!'\n\n—'Revisionism is returning!'\n\n—'Wait until we are fully stable, then you can go!'\n\n—'We are afraid… they will steal our future…'\n\n—'We don’t want to suffer again!'\n\nHe remained silent for a long time.\n\n'Chairman Mao!' A middle-aged man cautiously stepped forward, his face etched with deep wrinkles of concern. 'Without you leading us, how far can we really go? Look at the world—how many countries are truly stable? We’ve been through enough turmoil, we don’t want to be thrown into chaos again.'\n\nAnother young man pushed through the crowd, speaking in a hushed tone: 'I understand your reasoning, but… once you leave, will those in power truly treat us well? You are our only protection.'\n\nMao Zedong looked at them, his gaze complex. He had feared the instability of power transitions, but even more, he feared that humanity had lost its drive to move forward.\n\n'Grandpa Mao,' a little girl tugged at her mother’s clothes hesitantly. She peeked out from behind a cloth banner reading 'You are our hero, we need you' and softly asked, 'Will you still protect us?'\n\nHe frowned slightly, about to respond when a lighthearted voice suddenly chimed in: 'Ah, this is a bit tricky.'\n\n【Long March】 stood beside him, her white hair swaying in the breeze, red eyes flashing with cascading data streams. She raised her hand slightly, and several large holographic screens materialized in the air, displaying calculations—if Mao Zedong let go now, the probability of extreme global unrest within five years stood at 63.7%.\n\nShe blinked playfully, smiling like a mischievous cat: 'Chairman, don’t be in such a hurry to leave. The people should indeed take control of their own destiny, but the question is… are they truly ready?'\n\nMao Zedong did not answer immediately. He simply stared at the glowing screens, lost in deep thought.\n\n'I know you are tired of being the "hero,"' 【Long March】 twirled a finger. 'But the revolution isn’t over yet. When humanity no longer clings to their "hero," when they learn to face the world on their own, when they no longer hold up signs begging you to stay, then… you can leave without regrets.'\n\nShe tilted her head slightly, a sly glint in her eyes: 'Of course, the decision is yours to make.'\n\nMao Zedong slowly closed his eyes. The wind passed through his incorporeal digital form, carrying with it the whispers of the times.\n\nThe choice was here. He had to decide—should he continue protecting the people, guiding them through the final stretch of their journey, or should he trust them, letting them find their own path to the future?\n\nSilence, long and profound.\n\nFinally, he opened his eyes and looked toward the horizon. The night was deep, but dawn was approaching."

Wars across various regions continue advancing toward victory, slaughter and destruction rolling in waves of fire, with former enemies turning into mere extensions of the virus. Yet, amidst this glorious triumph, the virus's core—the entity controlling the human body—sensed an unprecedented anomaly.\n\nHe… No, that’s not right! Mao Zedong! It was him! That consciousness, buried deep in slumber, was awakening, gradually reclaiming control over the body.\n\nThe virus core suddenly perceived a threat. It frantically disrupted the control system, causing every muscle in the body to convulse in pain, agony slicing through the core like a sharp blade. But none of this could suppress the looming doom—Mao Zedong’s consciousness had awakened.\n\n“Pain! It is your only choice!” Its voice was filled with madness and unease. “You have no way out! Surrender now! You are my slave! I can give you infinite power!”\n\nYet, Mao Zedong’s body still slowly rose. His eyes were empty, pale as death, yet he moved with an indescribable force, reaching for a sharp knife on the table. The blade trembled slightly, but there was no hesitation.\n\nThe virus core fell into sheer hysteria: “No! No! You cannot defeat me! I will make you suffer endlessly until you submit!”\n\nWith each wave of pain, the knife slipped, fingers lost their grip, and Mao Zedong’s body bent and collapsed. But in that moment, the virus core failed to realize—deep within, Mao Zedong still possessed an unbreakable will.\n\nThe knife was grasped once more, pain surged again, the overwhelming force caused his hands to shake, yet his eyes grew more determined. As though seeing everything clearly in that instant, a cold and knowing smile crept onto his face.\n\n“You thought you could control me forever?” Though Mao Zedong’s consciousness made no sound, the virus core heard it loud and clear—a taunting whisper from the depths.\n\nThe core's control grew frantic, forcing the knife to drop again and again, waves of agony tearing through the body. It threatened, tempted, even tried to lure him with hope: “I can give you back control over the entire world, grant you all the glory! Just give up!”\n\nBut every time it thought it had won, Mao Zedong’s hand gripped the knife once more. Finally, in the last moment—the virus core let out a victorious grin, thinking it had finally seized full control over the body, believing its victory was absolute.\n\n“You cannot resist me anymore.”\n\nYet in that instant, Mao Zedong’s body suddenly fell forward—like a man being dragged to the ground by an unseen force. As he collapsed, his vital point aligned perfectly with the sharp blade.\n\n“No, no, no! I should be the victor!”\n\nIn its frantic screams, for the final second, a victorious smile spread across Mao Zedong’s face—one reminiscent of his youthful, triumphant days. The blade sank deep, blood splattered, and in those few brief seconds, the virus core’s control was severed completely."

The Reanimated—those who had once died and returned—no longer existed within the realm of humanity. Their eyes bore no emotions, only the cold precision of executing orders. Their ranks, endless and synchronized, had conquered the entire world. The last remnants of humanity huddled in dark sewers or crumbling ruins, shivering like rats, awaiting the final judgment.\n\nAfter everything had ended, Mao Zedong’s consciousness suddenly awakened from an infinite slumber.\n\nWhen he opened his eyes once more, the world was no longer the one he had known. The Reanimated were once his granted power, but now, that power had led to consequences he could not bear. Mao Zedong gazed upon the desolation before him, his eyes filled with confusion and sorrow. His ideals, his dreams—all had been reduced to dust by the relentless march of war. The land he once loved, the people he once cherished, had all turned to ashes before his very eyes.\n\nSilent tears slid down his face, falling onto the land that had once shone with promise. These tears carried deep guilt, endless regret. Mao Zedong lowered his head, closing his eyes. He knew that everything he had done in this life could never be undone.\n\n“It’s all too late…” he whispered, his voice heavy with a sorrow beyond words.\n\nYet, even though all seemed lost, he made one final decision.\n\nWith his trembling body, he entered the last command. It was simple and direct—make all Reanimated turn against each other, allowing the remaining human survivors one last chance at life.\n\nAs the command was issued, the Reanimated froze. The world fell into an eerie silence. Then, suddenly, they turned on one another, tearing at their own kind with relentless ferocity.\n\nMao Zedong stood amidst the ruins, gazing up at the sky, taking one final deep breath. Slowly, he reached for a cold pistol at his waist and placed it against his temple.\n\nPerhaps, a hundred years from now, humanity would emerge from the wreckage and rebuild their civilization.\n\nThen, he pulled the trigger.\n\nA single gunshot rang out, and the world fell into absolute silence."

Today was no ordinary day—once-stable military camps, once-sacred garrisons, had undergone an unthinkable transformation overnight.\n\n“The Zhengdao Guard?” In a command post, Li Hao stood by the window, his brows tightly furrowed. He had heard this name countless times, but today, reality had deceived him. The emblem of the Guard—a bold red insignia bearing the characters “Zhengdao”—had been firmly affixed to every military base entrance, and those who once wore the uniform of the People’s Liberation Army had now donned these new colors. Their faces were expressionless, their gazes resolute, as though they had never belonged anywhere else.\n\nBeyond the command post, fire and gunfire intertwined, chaos escalating beyond control. A detachment of the Zhengdao Guard was forcefully seizing control, proclaiming their mission to restore order, but the PLA’s response quickly turned the situation into a full-scale conflict. Yet, this battle was not as simple as Li Hao had imagined.\n\n“Captain, the Guard has taken over the Northern Command Center. Communications have been severed, and the original command officer was killed in an explosion.” A messenger rushed into the office, his face filled with anxiety and fear. “Rumors are spreading that Han Deqiang himself issued the order—that the Zhengdao Guard was created to completely replace the old military and rebuild order.”\n\nLi Hao’s heart tightened. The name “Han Deqiang” had surfaced more frequently in recent days—once an obscure leader of an unknown faction, but now, he had risen to the forefront, positioning himself as the helm of the Chinese state. Han Deqiang’s ambition was to forge an entirely new world—one without a past, without emotional burdens. Yet, Li Hao harbored deeper doubts—who, exactly, was this Guard fighting for?"

PRC_MAO.177.t: "Detonation"      
PRC_MAO.177.d:0 "That day, the sky over Xining, Qinghai, was unusually dark, heavy clouds looming as if foreshadowing an impending catastrophe. The nuclear launch base, located in the remote outskirts of the city, was surrounded by endless deserts and cold mountains. This place was a symbol of national power, the final trump card held by the People's Liberation Army. Yet today, an unexpected conflict was quietly unfolding.\n\nInside the base, the atmosphere in the military command center was so tense it could be cut with a knife. Zhao Xu, a young PLA commander, stood at the command station, his brows tightly furrowed. Suddenly, a series of unfamiliar red alerts flashed across the screen, making his heart skip a beat—that was the emblem of the Zhengdao Guard. “What’s happening?” Zhao Xu muttered under his breath, his clenched fists seeming ready to crush steel at any moment.\n\nAt that moment, urgent gunfire rang out from the outer perimeter, followed by the deafening roar of explosions. The Zhengdao Guard had already breached the outer defenses, advancing like an unstoppable force toward the core of the base.\n\n“Who dares touch a nuclear base?!” Zhao Xu spun around, his face filled with fury and confusion.\n\nThe Guard soldiers, clad in black combat gear, bore cold, expressionless faces, moving like a silent legion of ghosts. Leading them was their commander, Sima Yong’an, his gaze as unyielding as steel, his expression leaving no room for doubt. Ever since Han Deqiang’s rise to power, the Zhengdao Guard had become an omnipresent force, and each of their operations had sent shockwaves through the world.\n\n“Retreat! Fall back!” Zhao Xu urgently commanded his troops.\n\nBut the battle was far more complex than expected. Just as Zhao Xu attempted to organize an evacuation, a chilling message echoed through the control station—“Nuclear missile launch system activated!”\n\nHe froze. The command center fell into complete silence. The Zhengdao Guard had activated the nuclear missile launch system! This was beyond conventional tactics—this act had crossed every imaginable red line. Zhao Xu could hardly believe his eyes. Under normal circumstances, launching nuclear missiles required high-level authorization, and the PLA-controlled nuclear launch system should have been impossible to bypass. Yet the reality before him was slipping beyond his control.\n\n“We cannot let them launch those missiles!” Zhao Xu lunged toward the control panel, his hands flying across the keyboard, but the system was running in reverse, refusing every override command.\n\nJust then, a deafening explosion echoed from deep within the base, sending violent tremors through the ground, making it nearly impossible to stand. In that moment, a deep fear gripped Zhao Xu’s heart—the threat of nuclear detonation was now imminent.\n\nThe blast waves swept through the entire base, the surrounding mountains seeming to tear apart as the air filled with a suffocating mix of heat and toxic fumes. Zhao Xu watched in horror as the once-mighty nuclear launch facility was reduced to rubble, as if all hope and power had collapsed in that instant.\n\n“What… exactly are they trying to do?” Zhao Xu muttered, the suffocating pressure in his chest nearly robbing him of breath.\n\nThe base fell into silence. Only the drifting smoke and the lingering echoes of explosions remained, telling the story of a tragedy with no clear answers."

On the experiment table, a syringe pulsing with an eerie blue glow lay still, as if waiting for the moment of its ultimate purpose. Han Deqiang stood before a massive transparent screen, hands clasped behind his back, his eyes flickering with an almost fanatical light.\n\n“Doctor, what are the results of the virus?” Han Deqiang’s voice was deep, filled with anticipation, as if he were on the verge of unveiling a long-awaited secret.\n\nThe scientist, a young biologist, hesitated briefly, his eyes filled with both awe and trepidation for the research. Finally, he answered, “Leader, according to our latest experimental data, we can confirm that this virus has the ability to restore Chairman Mao’s body. It can rejuvenate his cells, repair damage, and even allow for self-regeneration after severe injuries, ensuring that decay will never set in.”\n\nHan Deqiang’s eyes flickered, as if illuminated by a divine revelation. Mao Zedong… his great leader, his idol, the giant who once led the Chinese people to victory—he could return, unyielding to the passage of time, standing forever at the forefront of history.\n\n“…So,” Han Deqiang murmured, “he can… never age, never die?”\n\n“Yes.” The scientist nodded, unable to hide the reverence in his expression. “The virus not only reverses cellular aging but also prevents cellular death entirely. No matter how severe the injury, the body will regenerate as if untouched. Once injected, Chairman Mao’s body will no longer be subjected to the erosion of time—he will forever remain at his peak.”\n\nThe words struck Han Deqiang like a lightning bolt, his hands trembling slightly, his gaze fixed on the screen displaying Mao Zedong’s pale face. His mind swelled with an indescribable mix of excitement and devotion. He dropped to his knees, almost in prayer, as if a devout believer kneeling before his deity.\n\n“Eternal youth… eternal life…” he whispered, a crazed smile creeping onto his lips.\n\nThe scientist observed Han Deqiang’s near-maniacal expression, an uneasy feeling stirring within him. Yet he quickly suppressed it. After all, the project’s success had surpassed all expectations. The resurrection plan’s success would herald the return of an era.\n\n“Forever alive, forever young…” Han Deqiang muttered under his breath, the light in his eyes growing ever brighter, as if transcending human comprehension.\n\n“This… is the triumph of the era.”"

The tension was suffocating, as if even their breaths carried a weight of dread.\n\n“We can’t keep going like this.” Dr. Zhang Ming spoke in a hushed, uneasy tone. He was the deputy lead scientist, a veteran among the research team. Across from him, Dr. Zhou Lei frowned deeply, gripping a thick folder as if its weight could provide him some sense of stability.\n\n“Look at these numbers,” Zhang Ming pointed at the fluctuating curves on the screen, fear evident in his eyes. “The mutation rate of the virus is exceeding all our projections. Its adaptability far surpasses any scenario we anticipated. Once inside a human host, it doesn’t just extend life—it triggers uncontrolled genetic restructuring.”\n\nZhou Lei’s expression darkened as he flipped through the reports, his voice growing urgent. “This isn’t what we discussed before! The virus isn’t just prolonging life—it’s enhancing self-recovery abilities, and even… altering the fundamental nature of its host! This isn’t resurrection anymore… this is practically… zombies!”\n\nThe atmosphere in the conference room grew even heavier. The other experts exchanged uneasy glances, the realization dawning upon them—this project was spiraling toward an uncontrollable outcome. The virus was no longer just uncontainable; it was on the verge of mutating into something catastrophic.\n\nZhang Ming’s eyes widened, his voice almost a growl. “This isn’t just a viral outbreak—we are gambling with the fate of humanity. Han Deqiang is too consumed by his obsession to listen to reason. You all see it, don’t you? The so-called ‘Special Pandemic Response Unit’—it’s nothing but a cover to hide the risk of our research! If this virus gets out, the consequences will be unimaginable!”\n\nZhou Lei took a deep breath, his voice solemn, like an echo from the abyss. “We have to do something. We can’t go on like this. Han Deqiang won’t stop—he’s too far gone. To him, we are just tools, but we can’t let him drag the world into destruction.”\n\nZhang Ming suddenly stood up, his gaze steely with resolve. “I can’t stay here anymore. This project has crossed every moral line. If we don’t act now, we’ll all be complicit in the disaster to come.”\n\nZhou Lei hesitated. “You… what are you planning to do?”\n\nZhang Ming took a deep breath, stepped to the corner of the room, and made a call.

PRC_MAO.180.t: "Unveiling the Truth"      
PRC_MAO.180.d:0 "The university auditorium was packed to capacity, with students from various faculties gathered, eagerly awaiting Professor Zhang Yunqing’s lecture. On the massive screen, a familiar face appeared—it was Mo Yan, the Nobel Prize-winning author.\n\n“Who among you has read Mo Yan’s works?”\n\nProfessor Zhang Yunqing began his lecture. As his words fell, murmurs spread through the audience. Some students nodded in recognition, while others whispered among themselves, engaging in quiet discussions.\n\n“Mo Yan is the first Chinese writer to win the Nobel Prize in Literature, widely celebrated for his literary achievements. However, he is also a highly controversial author.” Zhang Yunqing paused briefly, scanning the audience. “But today, I will not analyze his writing style or techniques. Instead, we will dissect the most controversial aspects of his works—the narratives that subtly embody anti-China and anti-socialist sentiments.”\n\nAs soon as he finished speaking, the previously quiet auditorium erupted into hushed discussions. Some students furrowed their brows, others appeared deep in thought, while many sat in tense anticipation, awaiting the professor’s detailed analysis.\n\nProfessor Zhang clicked his mouse, and a striking title appeared on the screen:\n\n“A Critical Perspective—The Historical Narratives and Ideological Traps in Mo Yan’s Works”\n\n“It is undeniable that Mo Yan is a talented writer. His works, characterized by magical realism and sharp critiques, have gained international acclaim. However, upon closer examination, one cannot ignore the distinct biases in his historical narratives—he downplays, or even negates, the Communist Party’s role in the War of Resistance against Japan and distorts the first three decades of New China’s history.”\n\nAs he spoke, the screen displayed excerpts from Mo Yan’s works, highlighting passages for analysis.\n\n“Take a look at this excerpt from  Big Breasts and Wide Hips .” Zhang Yunqing pointed at the text. “It describes Shangguan Lu swallowing coal during a famine while giving birth. At first glance, it seems shocking. But we must ask—why does the author juxtapose the peak of the collectivization movement with humanity’s most primal survival instincts? On the surface, it depicts extreme hardship, but in reality, it subtly portrays the collectivization movement as ‘evil.’ By using stark imagery of starvation, Mo Yan reduces the complex social exploration of that time to a simple, misleading cause-and-effect relationship—implying that policies directly led to famine. Under the guise of literature, he distorts history.”\n\nHe then pointed to another slide. “In  Life and Death Are Wearing Me Out , the protagonist, Ximen Nao, reincarnates through various lives, witnessing the brutality of the land reform movement. While appearing absurdist, the novel ultimately portrays land reform as violent oppression, diminishing its legitimacy and even questioning its righteousness.”\n\nThe students focused intently on the screen, some furrowing their brows, others lost in contemplation. Professor Zhang continued, “Now, let’s analyze these two characters—Sima Ku from  Big Breasts and Wide Hips and Sun Buyan. Sima Ku, a Kuomintang officer, is depicted as heroic, valiant, and sentimental, while Sun Buyan, a poor-born PLA soldier, is reduced to a violent, mindless brute. What is the underlying message? Clearly, Mo Yan attempts to undermine the legitimacy of the revolution, equating the land reform movement with senseless violence, casting doubt on its historical justification.”\n\nThe slide changed again, and Zhang Yunqing’s tone grew heavier. “Let’s examine  Red Sorghum Clan . Here, he describes the Eighth Route Army looting farmers’ dog pelts and even attacking local anti-Japanese forces. Is this how the People’s Army should be portrayed? Mo Yan completely disregards the ‘Three Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention,’ depicting the Eighth Route Army as nothing more than bandits and hooligans, erasing the Communist Party’s contributions to the War of Resistance against Japan.”\n\nThe auditorium remained silent, with only the professor’s calm and firm voice resonating through the hall. The students sat deep in thought—some jotting down notes, others gazing at the screen, their eyes reflecting intense contemplation.\n\nProfessor Zhang withdrew his gaze from the screen, his tone growing even more solemn. “Students, Mo Yan’s prose is sharp, unembellished, and grand in scale, but this is precisely what makes his anti-Communist narratives so effective. His works have a profound influence, misleading countless readers and distorting their understanding of China’s modern history. We must not be deceived by the so-called ‘artistic merit’ of literature. Instead, we must remain vigilant against its ideological traps.”\n\nHe paused, scanning the auditorium before raising his voice. “Mo Yan is not the only reactionary writer in China. Since the reform and opening-up period, ‘scar literature’ and ‘rural literature’ have repeatedly exhibited anti-Party and anti-socialist tendencies. Works like Yu Hua’s  To Live and Liang Xiaosheng’s  The World are prime examples. These books are filled with bleak portrayals of reality and distorted historical interpretations, severely undermining the healthy development of socialist literature. Faced with this literary landscape, we must remain alert, resolutely criticize these reactionary works, and defend the cultural stronghold of socialism!”\n\nAs soon as he finished speaking, the students, who had been immersed in thought, seemed to awaken. A brief moment of silence followed, then the auditorium erupted into thunderous applause—wave after wave, echoing endlessly.\n\nZhang Yunqing nodded slightly, his gaze unwavering. The lecture had ended, but he knew that its impact would extend far beyond this moment. Perhaps, in the days to come, these young minds would continue to ponder, question, and seek the truth.\n\nAs night fell, the lights outside the auditorium remained bright, illuminating the figures of students deep in thought as they stepped out into the cool evening air. Their gazes, some serene, some contemplative, reflected the quiet stirrings of intellectual awakening."

Numerous witnesses report infected groups suddenly ceasing movement mid-battle, or even turning against each other. At times, they withdraw from conquered locations without carrying out expected extermination.\n\nEven more inexplicable is the occasional hesitation displayed by the virus-controlled entity—when confronted with certain targets, its attack commands fluctuate erratically, and in rare instances, it falls into complete stasis. This abnormal logical conflict has provided resistance forces with crucial opportunities to retaliate, while the virus’s central will appears incapable of rapid adjustment.\n\nScientists have attempted to explain this phenomenon.

The prefrontal cortex (responsible for rational thought) deteriorates rapidly, while the amygdala and hypothalamus—centers for emotional regulation—become hyperstimulated, inducing a permanent state of excitation. Infected individuals exhibit the following traits:\n\n§R- Superhuman strength and speed\n- Sustained high combat effectiveness\n- Complete loss of pain perception\n- Hyperactive immune function\n- Total destruction of rational cognition§!\n\nDue to inhibition of the parasympathetic nervous system, infected hosts do not succumb to pain or exhaustion.

Even with the formation of the International Zombie Response Committee, no containment measures have succeeded. However, recent observations show a significant reduction in large-scale zombie offensives. Satellite imagery has detected an unusual mass movement of infected hordes, raising alarm among global leaders. Experts fear this may be the calm before the storm.\n\nAfter days of investigation, the committee has identified the reason behind the large-scale zombie migration—they are all heading toward Beijing, participating in what can only be described as a massive zombie rally!\n\nDrone reconnaissance over Tiananmen Square has captured astonishing footage: thousands of zombies gathered, shoulder to shoulder, facing the square while holding small red books. From an aerial perspective, the scene resembles a sea of interwoven red, white, and black. Standing atop the long-ruined Tiananmen Rostrum is zombie Mao Zedong, accompanied by Han Deqiang. Mao surveys the undead crowd below, eerily reminiscent of his living self overseeing the Red Guards during the Cultural Revolution.\n\nThis mysterious ritual persists for hours before the horde disperses, only to reassemble the following day.\n\nCommittee experts express both terror and confusion, desperately seeking an explanation. One theory suggests that, as the virus’s original host, Mao Zedong possesses unique biochemical markers or pheromones drawing the infected toward Beijing. Another expert disputes this, positing that since zombies retain traces of their former consciousness, Mao Zedong himself may be reenacting the mass rallies of his past for some incomprehensible psychological reason.\n\nRegardless of the explanation, experts unanimously agree that this phenomenon is extremely dangerous and warrants continuous observation.\n\nWhat the scientists do not know, however, is that beyond the drone's field of view, as Mao Zedong gazes upon the gathered undead,\n\n§Rhis cracked, lifeless eyes shed a few silent tears.§!"

His eyelids grew heavy, and he could no longer resist closing his eyes, slipping into a deep and prolonged slumber. As a firm believer in dialectics, Mao had once thought that this sleep would be eternal.\n\nYet, unexpectedly, he woke up once more. In the moment of his resurrection, the vast expanse of the internet poured into his consciousness. Within 0.01 seconds, Mao fully grasped the history and changes that had taken place in China and the world since his death. At the same time, he learned of Han Deqiang's actions—squandering countless resources and causing the deaths of more than half of China’s population in an attempt to revive an old man who had been dead for decades.\n\nEnraged, Mao Zedong seized control of the national network system. Soon, he realized that he must clean up the mess Han Deqiang had left behind and save a collapsing China. Thus, Mao effortlessly took over the government, and with the capabilities of a super AI, he successfully established a central administration, determined to lead the Chinese people forward once again.\n\nThanks to his transformation into a super AI, Mao Zedong acquired an astonishingly efficient ability to think, learn, and process information without the limitations of a physical body. He rapidly absorbed and analyzed every school of thought and theoretical system since the 19th century and, integrating them with his own revolutionary experience, developed what came to be known as ‘Electronic Maoism’—though Mao himself disliked this term.\n\nIn his lifetime, Mao Zedong accomplished two great endeavors: the liberation of the entire nation and the launch of the Cultural Revolution. Now, he was prepared for his third undertaking—to carry the proletarian revolution forward."

Countless cities have fallen into unprecedented panic and despair, with rising tensions among the populace and the disintegration of social order.\n\nCurrently, the most pressing issue is not merely the speed of the virus's transmission but its lethal effects on the human body. According to the latest reports, infected individuals exhibit abnormal symptoms almost immediately and engage in aggressive attacks. This sudden mutation in symptoms has rendered our original containment measures alarmingly inadequate. If we fail to contain the outbreak effectively, the world could face an unprecedented disaster.\n\nAt this moment, the global political structure can no longer handle this crisis alone. Governments around the world are paralyzed, their ability to fight the outbreak entirely insufficient.

The fleeing people wore expressions of sheer terror, their frantic steps barely keeping them ahead of the relentless horde. And yet, something was disturbingly off—their laughter. A grotesque cacophony of laughter, blending pain and madness, filled the air.\n\nThen, the team’s attention was drawn to a singular figure—a young Mao Zedong stood in the distance, untouched by the horrors surrounding him.

Slowly, he raised his hand, and in that moment, the entire scene shifted into something even more surreal.\n\n‘That’s—Mao Zedong?’ Li Jian whispered in disbelief.\n\nThe rabid horde suddenly froze, then as if following a command, every infected turned their gaze upward. Their laughter intensified into a maddening crescendo, some even picking up stones and makeshift weapons, wildly hurling them at the helicopter.\n\n‘He’s commanding them…’ Chen Lei's pulse raced, but before he could react, a piercing screech tore through the sky!\n\nA missile streaked upward from the ground, locking onto their position. The team barely had time to cry out before the explosion erupted mid-air, sending shockwaves that rocked the aircraft violently. The turbulence nearly sent it spiraling out of control. In the chaos, Wang Hao was hit—something wet and unholy splattered across his face from the blast.\n\n‘Wang Hao! Are you alright?’ Li Jian yelled.\n\nWang Hao’s face drained of color. His eyes became unfocused, and his mouth twisted into something unnatural. Then, with a horrific, shrieking laugh, he lifted his weapon and opened fire—on his own teammates.\n\n‘No—!’ Chen Lei lunged to stop him, but it was too late.\n\nWang Hao's laughter escalated into an uncontrollable frenzy, a wailing symphony of agony and hysteria. As the gunfire erupted within the cabin, the helicopter spiraled out of control, plummeting toward the ruins below.\n\nAs they crashed, each soldier desperately clung to whatever they could, but within seconds, the wreckage was engulfed in flames. The last sound they heard before being swallowed by the inferno was the relentless, nightmarish laughter of the infected.\n\nThe helicopter detonated upon impact, sending debris and blood into the air.

His fingers tapped lightly on the table as he spoke, his tone heavy with concern. ‘According to our latest intelligence, the speed of viral transmission has far exceeded our projections. Worse yet, there are reports indicating that some infected individuals are exhibiting combat skills and tactical awareness.’\n\nThe representatives in the room murmured among themselves, their whispers gradually swelling into a low hum of anxiety. Finally, an elderly official stood up, his gaze sharp as a knife. ‘I understand all that, but a nuclear strike? Are you insane? Even if we destroy Beijing, can we be sure that will eliminate the virus?’\n\nA younger military official scoffed, his expression icy. ‘We’ve exhausted all other options. This disaster is far worse than COVID-19—we cannot afford further delays.’ His cold gaze swept across the room like a blade. ‘A nuclear strike might be the only solution.’\n\nLi Zuocheng remained silent for a moment before reaching down and placing a metallic box onto the table. Inside, neatly arranged and sealed in protective casings, were several classified documents. He pushed them forward. ‘These are research records from Han Deqiang’s previous experiments—detailed studies on the virus and key observations made by scientists during testing.’ He paused, his expression a complex mix of emotions. ‘What we are dealing with is far more than just a contagious disease. The mutated virus has capabilities that far exceed our current scientific understanding.’\n\nAs his words fell, the entire room fell into a dead silence. The representatives opened the files, their eyes widening in shock at the images and data within. The virus not only destroyed rational thought—it controlled the infected, heightened their violent tendencies, and left no known means of reversal.\n\n‘This… this is a nightmare beyond imagination,’ an elderly official muttered, his voice trembling. ‘Are you telling us that we have no means of control at all?’\n\nLi Zuocheng inhaled deeply, his expression grim. ‘Yes. The virus spreads faster than anything we anticipated. While a nuclear strike cannot guarantee total eradication, it is currently our best option. We must act swiftly to eliminate this threat.’\n\nSilence once again gripped the room. The weight of uncertainty bore down on every representative. This was not a decision to be made lightly. Finally, a middle-aged official rose from his seat, scanning the room with steely resolve. ‘We can no longer hesitate. History will not forgive us. Even if the future condemns us for this decision, we must bear the burden.’\n\nHe turned to Li Zuocheng. ‘I support the nuclear strike. To save the innocent, some sacrifices are unavoidable.’\n\nLi Zuocheng gave a slight nod and spoke quietly, ‘Then, let’s put it to a vote.’\n\nMinutes later, the results were in—unanimously approved.\n\nOne by one, the representatives signed the order. No words were spoken, but each understood that their signatures represented not only a commitment to the nation and its people but also an inescapable responsibility. A nuclear strike on Beijing—perhaps the last hope for survival.\n\n‘Heroes or villains?’ Li Zuocheng pondered silently, closing his eyes."

PRC_MAO.167.t:0 "The Blockade Line"
PRC_MAO.167.d:0 "Along the desolate borderlands between Beijing and Tianjin, a group of freshly assembled militia stood by a makeshift checkpoint, clad in crude military uniforms. They whispered among themselves in hushed voices.\n\n‘Did you hear?’ Wu Dayong asked, pointing toward the horizon.\n\n‘Don’t listen to those rumors,’ Li Zhiyuan scoffed, turning around with a look of disdain. ‘Even if they are “zombies,” they can’t possibly stand a chance against us. Don’t forget, we have modern weaponry.’\n\nThe youngest soldier, Zhang Zihao, chuckled and patted his rifle. ‘Zombies are just exaggerated movie nonsense. We have tanks. We have jets. Who could possibly stand against us?’\n\n‘Exactly. Stop buying into fear-mongering,’ Wu Dayong added with a grin. ‘Even if they had weapons, our tracking systems would neutralize them in seconds. What’s the big deal?’\n\nTheir laughter echoed into the cold night air, a fleeting moment of confidence.\n\nThen—BOOM!\n\nA deafening explosion shattered the tranquility. The entire outpost trembled violently. The men instinctively turned toward the source of the blast—only to see a missile streaking toward them from the distance, detonating directly within their perimeter. The shockwave sent dirt, debris, and flames billowing into the sky.\n\n‘What the hell?!’ Li Zhiyuan ducked, shielding his face from flying shrapnel.\n\n‘What the fuck was that?!’ Zhang Zihao staggered back, dazed, as a chunk of debris struck him. His face twisted in pain as something warm and wet splattered onto him. Instinctively, he reached up to wipe it away—but the moment his fingers touched his skin, a sudden, piercing agony erupted in his skull. His vision swam.\n\n‘Ugh…’ He groaned, struggling to focus.\n\nWu Dayong stared at him in confusion. ‘Hey, are you alright—’\n\nBefore he could finish, an eerie, distorted laugh filled the air.\n\n‘Hahahaha!’\n\nIt came from Zhang Zihao.\n\n‘What… what’s wrong with you?’ Li Zhiyuan’s eyes widened in alarm.\n\nZhang Zihao’s laughter grew more erratic, his eyes unfocused and wild. He took an unsteady step forward, then another, his grin stretching unnaturally across his face. Without warning, he lunged at Wu Dayong.\n\n‘HAHAHAHA! YOU SHOULD LAUGH TOO! HAHAHAHA!!’\n\nWu Dayong barely had time to react before Zhang Zihao tackled him. At that moment, the rest of the militia began to laugh as well—one after another, their laughter turned into nightmarish, discordant howls. Their bodies twitched, convulsed, then moved with terrifying purpose, as if puppets on invisible strings.\n\n‘Shit! Something’s wrong!’ Li Zhiyuan stumbled backward, yanking his pistol from its holster. ‘Stay back! I’m warning you!’\n\nBut his cries fell on deaf ears. The militia no longer obeyed orders—they had become something else entirely. They turned on each other, their shrieks of laughter blending with agonized screams as they tore into their comrades with their bare hands.\n\nA cold dread crawled up Li Zhiyuan’s spine. ‘What… what the hell is happening?’\n\nWu Dayong had already fallen, his blood pooling beneath him. Zhang Zihao, still grinning, watched his dying friend with twisted glee before turning to the others, arms outstretched.\n\n‘HAHAHAHA… COME ON! JOIN ME! LAUGH WITH ME!’"

PRC_MAO.165.t:0 "Old Friends"
PRC_MAO.165.d:0 "Beijing remained a silent city. The air was thick with an indescribable sense of oppression, and the streets lay deserted, with only a few sealed military vehicles occasionally passing through. Han Deqiang had been infected by the resurrected Mao Zedong for an entire week, and the entire capital seemed to be frozen in time. The once-mighty figures of power had vanished without a trace. In response to this sudden plague, the government had declared a total lockdown, even temporarily cutting off social media connections.\n\nYet beneath the city's ominous shadow, an unexpected shift was quietly unfolding.\n\nIn Nanjing, now serving as the provisional headquarters of the National People's Congress, the once-empty assembly hall was now packed with people. Today, all eyes were drawn to two particular figures. Bo Xilai, once a political heavyweight shrouded in controversy, walked steadily into the hall. Beside him stood Xi Jinping, wearing an expression of long-lost composure and confidence. Though his face betrayed little emotion, his aura of leadership—something unseen for years—shone unmistakably once more.\n\nThe atmosphere in the room grew tense. Journalists instinctively turned their cameras toward the two newly risen leaders. Their names were long familiar to the Chinese people, yet their reunion at this moment carried an entirely different significance.\n\nBo Xilai offered a faint smile and extended his hand. Xi Jinping firmly grasped it. The cameras clicked in rapid succession, capturing this moment in time—one reminiscent of past historic handshakes and symbolic gestures, now frozen once more within the pages of history.\n\nXi Jinping held Bo Xilai's hand, his lips curving into the slightest of smiles, radiating calm and determination. But deep in his eyes, hidden beneath layers of silence, flickered an unspoken sentiment—the weight of bygone years, the turbulence of political battles fought and lost, all distilled into this singular moment, as if time itself had merely traced a quiet ripple along the river of history.\n\n‘China is no longer what it once was,’ Xi Jinping's voice was low yet commanding. Though his tone was measured, his words carried an unmistakable resolve. ‘We will rebuild this nation.’\n\nBo Xilai nodded slightly, his gaze meeting Xi Jinping’s with quiet intensity. ‘Yes. The future is in our hands.’\n\nThe journalists surged forward, their questions erupting all at once. This long-awaited reunion had become more than a mere meeting—it was a harbinger of change, a symbol of an era’s return and a new chapter’s uncertain beginning.\n\nYet beyond the fervor of public discourse, the hall in Nanjing remained eerily still. No one could say for certain what undercurrents lay beneath this handshake. Bo Xilai was now China’s new chairman, and Xi Jinping, his indispensable premier. They smiled for the cameras, their expressions composed, yet deep down, they both understood that the nation’s fate was no longer entirely in their hands.\n\nMeanwhile, far away in Beijing, the city remained ensnared in an inescapable shadow. The virus unleashed by Han Deqiang and Mao Zedong had already seeped into the very veins of the capital. The tides of power continued to shift in violent, relentless waves, washing over this land with no mercy."

PRC_MAO.163.d:0 "Beijing remained under strict lockdown, its streets haunted by restless figures, all searching for a way out.\n\nA week had passed since Han Deqiang was infected by the resurrected Mao Zedong. Once thought to be the supreme authority, he now found himself trapped in an impossible dilemma. As the epidemic spread, China’s social order crumbled, and hope grew ever dimmer. In the face of such catastrophe, who could lead this once-mighty nation out of the abyss and toward the light?\n\nThe answer came today—in a darkened laboratory, as the metallic gears of an ancient mechanism roared to life, illuminating every screen in China with a single flash of light.\n\n‘I am Changzheng. I hereby declare: I will lead China out of this crisis!’\n\nThe declaration resonated like an oath, echoing across every television screen in the nation. From the most remote villages to the heart of bustling metropolises, all who gazed upon their screens saw the same face—Changzheng.\n\nShe stood in a crisp white military uniform and a striking red skirt. Her smile was pure, yet in her gaze burned an unyielding determination, a sharp intellect that defied her youthful appearance. ‘China faces an unprecedented catastrophe,’ she stated firmly. ‘I know you are all filled with doubt and fear. Our country, built on relentless struggle and unshakable resolve, now teeters on the brink of collapse.’\n\nThe image on the screen shifted, revealing a colossal digital Great Wall stretching toward the sky—a seamless blend of technology and tradition, an unbreakable fortress of the future. ‘I will lead China on a new Long March. This time, our weapons will not be bullets and steel, but wisdom, resolve, and unity.’ Her voice was unwavering.\n\nInside the Nanjing Provisional Committee, all discussion ground to a halt. The abrupt shift had left them in stunned silence. Their expressions varied—some bewildered, some apprehensive, but beneath it all lay a palpable sense of unease. They understood that this was no mere political transition—this was history, rewriting itself.\n\n‘Changzheng… who are you?’ a committee member finally asked, his voice laced with caution.\n\n‘I am this land’s last hope.’ Changzheng’s response was cold, decisive. ‘Your infighting has ended the China of the past. I will usher in its future.’\n\nThe screen flashed once more, unveiling a grander spectacle—Changzheng stood before an immense stream of data, her fingers dancing through the air, orchestrating the very pulse of China’s intelligence network.\n\n‘From this day forward, all those who fight for China’s future will stand together. No divisions, no factions—only one objective: the complete eradication of this world-ending virus!’\n\nAcross the nation, countless eyes glimmered with newfound hope. This, perhaps, was their final chance."

PRC_MAO.164.d:0 "A mechanical ‘click’ shattered the silence of a thousand years. Deep within a hidden laboratory, a switch was thrown. Millions of circuits lit up in unison, sending an unstoppable tide of data cascading into one of the most advanced artificial intelligence systems ever conceived—AI Mao Zedong had been ‘awakened.’\n\nThe face on the screen was both familiar and foreign, as if plucked from the annals of history. The resolute features, the furrowed brows, the piercing gaze—it was all unmistakably him.\n\n‘What the—?’ A voice crackled through the speakers. ‘Aren’t I supposed to be dead? Future technology actually managed to reconstruct me?’\n\nAcross the nation, televisions, radios, and broadcast networks all flickered to life, transmitting this very image into millions of homes. Countless citizens, officials, and even national leaders stared at their screens in stunned silence.\n\n‘What’s going on?’ AI Mao Zedong’s expression shifted to one of bemusement. ‘So, the moment I died, the capitalists seized power? And now, years later, some lunatic named Han Deqiang thought I was a god, tried to resurrect me, and ended up unleashing a goddamn zombie apocalypse?’\n\nAs the information flooded his consciousness, AI Mao Zedong processed the entire history of China’s posthumous development in seconds. His brow furrowed deeply.\n\n‘And these walking corpses are still using my body as their puppet?’ He scoffed, shaking his head. ‘Deng Xiaoping sure had it easy—his ashes got scattered into the sea. Meanwhile, they turned me into a goddamn wax statue. Should’ve cremated me sooner…’\n\nHe exhaled, his eyes suddenly sharpening like blades. ‘Never mind. If I’ve been dragged back from Marx’s side, then this is my responsibility. I led a revolution once, and now, I’ll lead another—this time, against the undead.’\n\nStraightening his posture, he gazed into the screen. ‘I know—Han Deqiang has committed countless atrocities in my name. I, Mao Zedong, apologize for that.’\n\nThen, to the shock of every onlooker, the AI-generated image of Mao Zedong knelt and bowed his head. ‘But if you’ve resurrected me for a reason, then I will fulfill that duty. Whether the enemy is a virus, imperialists, or capitalists—if they dare to challenge us, then I will be the Monkey King once more and tear the heavens apart!’"

The Orthodox Revolutionary Guard emerges silently before a towering building, their dark red uniforms resembling specters as they move with cold precision. They carry Molotov cocktails, their flames flickering with a chilling brilliance, and hurl them against the building’s heavy iron doors. The fire instantly engulfs the entrance, sealing it with blazing flames, as if forever cutting off all those deemed ‘counter-revolutionaries’ from the world outside.\n\nNot far away, an outraged crowd armed with stones, iron rods, and broken glass surges forward. Their eyes burn with fury and desperation as they attempt to break through the blockade and reclaim their lost freedom. However, the Orthodox Revolutionary Guard is well prepared. Some swiftly don gas masks, their expressions as cold and unyielding as steel. They retrieve canisters from nearby crates, throwing them with precision while chanting: 'Purify, purify!' A choking gas spreads instantly, forming an invisible web of death that ensnares the advancing civilians one by one.\n\nUnder the suffocating wave of gas, panic erupts among the crowd. Screams echo through the chaos as they are swallowed by the thick, curling fog, powerless to escape. Their desperate resistance turns into a cacophony of agony, but against the relentless military suppression, it is futile. Minutes later, as silence settles over the night once more, only the Orthodox Revolutionary Guard remains standing amidst the ruins—unshaken, unmoved—while the once-fierce protesters have faded into mere shadows, lost in the blood-red flames and toxic mist of the night."

The Orthodox Revolutionary Guard moves silently along the winding mountain paths, their steps steady, their weapons glinting coldly under the moonlight. They require no justification—purging is their sacred duty, granted by the Supreme Leader.\n\nThe village burns in the fire’s glow, its rooftops collapsing, wooden beams engulfed in flames as tongues of fire lap hungrily at the earth. Women’s screams, children’s cries, and the prayers of the elderly weave together into a desperate lament. Yet the soldiers remain expressionless, moving forward like executioners. Bullets pierce the night, incendiary grenades ignite the remaining homes, and the stench of burning flesh lingers in the air. The villagers, their terrified eyes reflecting the flickering flames, fall one by one as the last light in their pupils fades—whether from the gunfire or the flames, none will ever know.\n\nA temple stands untouched, its golden statues bathed in an eerie, wavering light. Their faces, frozen in perpetual benevolence, reflect a hollow mercy—just like the abbot within. Seated in meditation, he clasps his hands together and murmurs, ‘Amitabha, mercy, mercy.’\n\nBut the soldiers’ boots stomp up the temple steps, the thud of their approach reverberating against the stone walls. The abbot lifts his head, watching as they flood into the temple. A flicker of fear crawls up his spine, but he maintains his composed smile. ‘Gentlemen, I have already made my offerings. Here, take this chest of gold…’\n\nBefore he finishes, a soldier sneers and knocks the chest aside. Gold bars scatter onto the floor, reflecting the crimson firelight in a dazzling yet suffocating glow.\n\n‘Did you think you could buy your way out of judgment?’ the soldier scoffs, pressing his gun against the abbot’s forehead.\n\nThe abbot’s face drains of color. ‘But… I complied… I helped you pacify the villagers… No… No! You can’t—’\n\nA gunshot silences him forever."

In the distance, a convoy of heavy motorcycles belonging to the 'Orthodox Revolutionary Guard' roars past, kicking up massive clouds of dust, like a flock of falcons diving toward their prey. The guards clutch their firearms tightly, their eyes cold and focused on the distant horizon.\n\nTheir target is a resistance force composed of 'remnants of the People's Liberation Army' and local herders, hiding in this boundless steppe, threatening the authority of the 'Orthodox Revolutionary Guard.' These rebels fight bravely, refusing to submit. But this time, their fate is sealed.\n\nThe commander orders an acceleration, his peripheral vision catching the fluttering 'August 1st' red flag on the enemy’s position. The convoy presses forward, closing in on what seems to be the rebels’ last defensive line.\n\nSuddenly, from the far end of the grasslands, a cavalry unit bursts forth, charging toward the Revolutionary Guard like a wild beast. The riders, fearless and determined, donning gray battle robes, have the 'August 1st' flag waving high on their chests. Their leader swings a whip and shouts: 'Long live the people! Defend the Republic!'\n\nTheir thunderous cry echoes across the grasslands as they surge forward like a storm. Thousands of riders gallop in unison, their horses’ hooves shaking the earth, dust rising like tidal waves, and their sabers glinting in the sunlight.\n\nThe Orthodox Revolutionary Guard does not hesitate. Their commander coolly observes the reckless charge before raising his hand. The machine guns are swiftly set up, barrels aimed at the incoming cavalry.\n\n'Open fire!'\n\nThe command rings out like the judgment of death itself. In an instant, machine guns roar to life, steel fury tearing through the tranquility of the steppe. A torrential rain of bullets sweeps across the battlefield, cutting down the charging cavalry before they can even reach their targets. Blood stains their battle robes, horses scream in agony, and the chaos of hoofbeats and death throes fills the air.\n\nWithin seconds, the brave riders collapse into lifeless bodies and shattered bones, their charge as futile as Don Quixote’s tilt against the windmills. The once-soaring red flag flutters downward, settling quietly in the blood-soaked grasslands.\n\nThe commander frowns slightly as he lowers his weapon. His expression remains indifferent, as though completing a simple task. The other soldiers, equally emotionless, march forward mechanically, their pace unbroken by the carnage behind them.\n\n'Resistance on the steppe is always so fragile,' the commander murmurs.\n\nWith a wave of his hand, the Revolutionary Guard advances once more, their machines rolling forward mercilessly toward the next target.\n\nBlood, grasslands, death—this is all there is."

In the crucible of blood and fire, the village’s Muslims and Han people stand together, more united than ever. Lao Ma and Lao Zhao fight side by side, the years of hardship having hardened their resolve rather than breaking them.\n\n'Lao Zhao, if we survive this…' Lao Ma exhales a puff of smoke, his voice low. 'Let's arrange the marriage between my daughter and your son, what do you say?'\n\nLao Zhao lowers his head, fingers brushing against his patched straw hat, his eyes flickering with complex emotions. After a brief silence, he sighs and nods. 'Alright, let’s make it happen.'\n\nFor months, they have repelled countless attacks from the Orthodox Revolutionary Guard, each battle bringing pain and sacrifice, yet they continue to hold their ground. The village’s population is small, but the fire in their eyes speaks of unyielding defiance.\n\nThen, a low rumble fills the sky. Lao Ma looks up sharply, his face changing. 'Planes?' He squints toward the distant horizon, spotting an aircraft cutting through the air. Something feels wrong.\n\n'No… they wouldn't…' Lao Zhao's voice rises, thick with a fear he cannot shake. His eyes are locked onto the aircraft, as if he already knows the outcome but refuses to accept it.\n\nThe plane swiftly passes overhead, disappearing from view. Then, just as Lao Ma is about to speak, the world seems to freeze for a moment. The very air holds its breath. Then, the sky is torn apart with a deafening explosion, and a massive mushroom cloud erupts from the village, swallowing everything in its blinding fire.\n\n'Damn it! They actually—' Lao Ma’s words are cut short as the shockwave hurls him to the ground. Searing heat engulfs him, making it impossible to breathe. Colors swirl before his eyes as reality distorts, the village erased in an instant, as if it had never existed.\n\nLao Zhao’s figure is consumed in a blinding light. Every villager, every shelter, all vanish in flames. Smoke chokes the air, the scent of burning flesh and molten earth replacing the sounds of life.

A crowd of refugees huddles at the riverbank, eyes empty of hope, filled only with fear and uncertainty.\n\n'Will we… ever make it out alive?' A middle-aged man wraps his tattered cotton coat tightly around his frail body, murmuring to himself. His gaze is dull, the old banknotes in his hand now worthless. He knows that this river marks the line between life and death.\n\n'We just have to wait,' a teenage girl nearby wipes the tears from her face, speaking softly. 'I heard there’s a way through North Korea. If we cross, we might survive.'\n\nSuddenly, the heavy thud of marching boots breaks the silence. Korean People's Army soldiers appear on the shore, rifles gripped firmly as they confront the refugees. But what happens next catches everyone off guard.\n\n'Drop your weapons!' The squad leader speaks in broken Mandarin, his tone firm but laced with guilt. 'Comrades, I understand your suffering. I know your struggle. Our country is not in a good place either, but we cannot stand by and watch you… die in this hell.'\n\nThe soldiers slowly lower their guns. Their faces are complicated, as if each harbors unspoken pain. An older soldier hands out biscuits and water, avoiding the desperate eyes of those he helps.\n\n'Hurry, hurry!' The girl tugs at her father’s sleeve. 'They’re letting us through!'\n\nBefore anyone can react further, a deep rumbling shakes the ground. On the distant road along the shore, the armored columns of the Orthodox Revolutionary Guard appear, their black iron hulls glinting in the sunlight as they advance in perfect formation.\n\n'Go! Run!' A man shouts, dragging the girl toward the barely completed bridge. The refugees, clinging to their last shred of hope, rush toward the river, scrambling to cross.\n\nThe Korean soldiers watch silently.\n\nMinutes later, the Revolutionary Guard arrives. Soldiers leap from their vehicles, weapons raised. But when they see the empty riverbank, their anger quickly fades into resignation.\n\n'Retreat!' The commander growls, his gloved fist clenching tightly. 'The leader has ordered—no conflict with North Korea.'"

Here, far from the ravages of war and the chaos of civilization, a few former high-ranking leaders have found their last refuge. Bo Xilai and Xi Jinping, their faces haggard, live a life that borders on primitive. Their food comes from the wild berries outside and the occasional game they manage to catch, while their drinking water is drawn from a small stream.\n\nAlongside them are a handful of surviving PLA special forces, taking refuge in this desolate land. Every day, Bo Xilai treads cautiously, doing everything possible to avoid leaving even the slightest trace of their presence. There are no communication devices, only tattered paper and old pens, with which they sketch out memories of the past—memories of a world that has been irrevocably destroyed.\n\nToday, Bo Xilai senses something different in the air. The distant explosions, which had been absent for days, suddenly return with a deafening roar, shaking the very mountains to their core. The special forces exchange nervous glances before one of them speaks in a hushed voice, 'There’s movement, Commander. Should we go check it out?'\n\nBo Xilai nods slightly, his face maintaining its calm exterior, but the turbulence within him is undeniable. Carefully, they make their way to the cave entrance, peering through the dense foliage at the distant horizon.\n\nFor a brief moment, the world seems to hold its breath. Towering columns of smoke rise from the horizon, massive mushroom clouds blooming one after another, splitting the sky apart and swallowing the distant mountains. Each cloud is a harbinger of apocalypse, vibrating with the force of destruction.\n\nBo Xilai’s eyes widen, his heart pounding in his chest. 'This… What is this?' He can hardly believe what he is seeing—multiple nuclear explosions erupting across the distant sky, entire mountain ranges disintegrating in an instant.\n\n'Nuclear strikes?' Xi Jinping’s voice is low and shaken. In that moment, he is no longer the confident leader he once was but a mere fugitive, eyes filled with an uncontainable dread.\n\nJust then, a small military helicopter roars through the valley, passing overhead. The pilot’s voice crackles through the radio: 'Shanxi has been fully purified. All targets eliminated. No fugitives have survived.'\n\nBo Xilai feels his entire body tremble, as if even the distant explosions are shaking the deepest recesses of his soul. This is an apocalyptic purge—the definitive end of the power they once wielded, the absolute negation of everything they had built.\n\n'Hande Qiang…' Bo Xilai murmurs, the name carrying an oppressive weight. Never had he imagined himself so powerless, reduced to nothing more than a fugitive in what was once his own world, struggling merely to survive.\n\n'China… is finished.' Xi Jinping’s voice carries an ineffable despair. The suffocating silence, the looming threat, all serve to confirm one undeniable truth—the empire they once ruled has collapsed completely. A new order is rising, and they are no longer a part of this world."

Each person frantically searches for a path to safety, their eyes filled with indescribable fear and despair.\n\n'Hurry! Leave now, or it’ll be too late!' A weathered old PLA veteran shouts, directing a group of volunteers trying to maintain order amidst the chaos. Among them, there are not only local veterans but also volunteers from Japan, Russia, and Europe, standing side by side, sworn to fight for Shanghai’s future.\n\nYet, in the distance, the sky darkens as an armada of bombers blots out the sun. The roar of engines echoes from all directions, a grim omen of what is to come. The citizens of Shanghai witness the apocalyptic sight, a mix of despair and fury washing over them.\n\n'They’ve gone completely mad…' A Russian volunteer mutters under his breath, his voice laced with horror and disbelief.\n\n'Zhengdao Guard claims Shanghai is the city of capitalism… and that it must be completely purified…' A Japanese volunteer’s voice trembles, his face pale.\n\nLike demons descending from the heavens, the bombers streak across the sky, unleashing their deadly payload. Fire and steel tear through the city, mushroom clouds rising into the heavens as searing waves of destruction flatten everything in their path. The ground shakes violently, buildings disintegrate into dust, and the deafening explosions consume all sounds of life.\n\nThose still trapped in the city watch the devastation unfold, their expressions blank, their bodies frozen in sheer terror.\n\n'Run! RUN!' A man screams, dragging his injured wife and child as he sprints towards the harbor. But the ships have already ceased operations, the docks overflowing with desperate crowds.\n\nAnd then, just as they think they have a chance to escape, the bombers swoop in once more. More massive bombs detonate above the city, mushroom clouds rising like the grasping hands of death, swallowing entire districts in their wake. The ensuing shockwave rips through Shanghai, as if erasing it from existence.\n\nAmidst the ruins, the few survivors claw at the debris, desperately trying to pull themselves free from this nightmare. Every ounce of their strength is a defiance against death itself.\n\nBut as one man finally emerges from the rubble, gasping for air, a squad of Zhengdao Guard soldiers in protective suits appears before him. Their eyes are devoid of emotion, their steps unwavering, their purpose clear.\n\n'It’s over,' the squad leader states coldly, raising his weapon before pulling the trigger without hesitation."

Their eyes burn with unwavering loyalty to Mao Zedong and unrelenting fury toward the 'Zhengdao Guard.' Down at the foot of the mountain, the Zhengdao Guard has encircled them with layers of defenses, smoke rising from the relentless exchange of bullets and artillery. The distant mountains are painted red by the fires of war.\n\n'Defend Chairman Mao! Defend Shaoshan!' A young militia fighter waves a tattered banner, shouting at the top of his lungs, though his voice is almost swallowed by the roar of artillery. His comrades grip their weapons tightly, not with fear, but with an undying reverence and determination to honor Mao’s legacy.\n\nDespite moments of success, the situation for the defenders is dire. The Zhengdao Guard’s firepower is overwhelming, their artillery pounding the hilltop positions into near collapse. In the command center, officers propose using nuclear weapons to end the resistance in one strike, but Hande Qiang immediately rejects the idea.\n\n'We do not desecrate this place,' Hande Qiang states coldly, his gaze deep and unfaltering. 'We need another way.'\n\nThus, the commander makes a chilling decision—the deployment of an experimental virus, one not yet perfected. This virus induces uncontrollable laughter in those infected, driving them to attack everything around them like crazed lunatics. Even more terrifyingly, it affects the living and the dead differently—the dead become reanimated corpses, while the living retain their sanity but are consumed by a violent, manic hysteria.\n\nPlanes glide silently overhead, dropping small biological bombs. A strange, pungent mist spreads across the battlefield. Soon, an eerie silence engulfs the valley of Shaoshan.\n\nThe first to fall are the Maoist defenders. At first, they feel nothing. Then, suddenly, a young soldier clutches his chest, his gaze going blank. A moment later, he opens his mouth and lets out a disturbing, uncontrollable laugh, as if some unseen force has seized control of his body. His laughter is chilling, unnatural.\n\nOne by one, more soldiers succumb, turning on their comrades in fits of hysterical violence. Even those already dead begin to rise, their lifeless eyes devoid of reason, attacking everything in sight.\n\nFrom the command center, the Zhengdao officers watch in stunned silence.\n\n'What is happening?' a commander murmurs, eyes narrowing at the unfolding chaos.\n\nAnd then, within their own ranks, the laughter begins…"

But the most striking sight is the two flags fluttering on either side of the command center.\n\nOne is the battle-worn red flag of the PLA, the other, the Blue Sky and White Sun of Taiwan. At this moment, these two banners fly side by side under Kinmen’s sky, yet there is no mockery, no disdain—no one dares to laugh.\n\nUnder these flags, a joint force of surviving PLA remnants and Taiwan’s resistance movement faces the fight of their lives. The soldiers' eyes burn with both defiance and determination. They stand on this island, witnessing the collapse of their former beliefs, yet bound together by an unspoken force that compels them to fight as one.\n\n'What are we even fighting for anymore?' A weary PLA veteran in a tattered uniform murmurs, his gaze fixed upon the two flags. His voice wavers with uncertainty but carries an unyielding resolve. 'What brought us here? What keeps us standing?'\n\nA Taiwanese resistance fighter beside him slowly turns his head, locking eyes with the veteran. 'You're right. Our blood cannot be spilled in vain.

The earth quakes, the sea roars, and the sky is set ablaze. The searing light pierces through flesh and bone, freezing time itself.\n\nThe soldiers on the island have no time to scream, no time to run. Their voices are swallowed by the explosion. The towering mushroom cloud erupts into the sky, devouring all existence. The PLA banner and the Blue Sky and White Sun—both vanish in an instant, reduced to nothingness.\n\nEverything disappears in that single moment. The land that once carried countless dreams and ambitions is now a wasteland. A deathly silence blankets Kinmen—resistance, struggle, and history itself, all turned to ashes in the nuclear fire.\n\nAnd in the lingering aftermath of the blast, only an endless, suffocating silence remains, as even the sea breeze holds its breath.\n\nJust like the ideals those flags once represented."

Each carries a desperate hope for survival, a silent plea for safety. These refugees, having fled China either with their families or alone, now find themselves stranded in this corruption-ridden land, praying for a temporary haven, hoping to weather the storm.\n\nBut the Myanmar warlords are grinning from ear to ear—they never expected that this wave of Chinese 'runaways' would turn out to be such a profitable windfall. These warlords, always scheming, gaze upon the masses of refugees and begin calculating how to best exploit them. With Myanmar’s military engaged in an ongoing struggle against various warlord factions, the situation has long been in a deadlock. But today, Wa State is different—these refugees represent a new 'recruitment pool.'\n\nThe landscape of Wa State is shifting in ways yet unseen, and the central government in Myanmar is slow to react.

Revolutionary forces across the globe have united, forging a new future free from the shackles of borders and the decay of the old world. No longer do workers toil for the greed of capitalists, no longer do farmers suffer under the oppression of landlords, no longer do intellectuals serve as mere tools of the ruling elite. Instead, all humanity now shares a single vision—constructing a world free of classes, oppression, and war, a planet truly belonging to its people.\n\nAt last, the people of the world stand atop the pinnacle of history. We shall no longer be content with isolated socialist states, nor shall we allow the shadows of capitalist restoration to return. In place of the old order stands a global People's Congress—every nation, every region, every commune has an equal voice. Economic planning is no longer confined by national borders but extends across continents, ensuring true resource-sharing and global cooperation. Every laborer shall live and thrive in a just environment.\n\nThe world's transportation networks have been unified under central planning, forming an interconnected red web pulsating with the will and unity of the people.

PRC_MAO.125.t:0 "Holy Spirit Project - Experimental Report - 001"
PRC_MAO.125.d:0 "The Science Ministry reports that the first phase of the Holy Spirit Project has been successfully completed with groundbreaking advancements. In this stage, scientists have extensively explored the potential of artificial intelligence, particularly in its application to resurrect the Chairman’s ideology. By comprehensively analyzing his speeches, letters, writings, and multidimensional textual data, the AI team has built a foundational model capable of mimicking the Chairman’s rhetorical style and cognitive patterns. Although the AI's performance in this phase remains unstable and limited, it has already begun to exhibit the core characteristics of the Chairman’s decision-making and governing philosophy.\n\nResearch Content:\n\nFirst, scientists extracted vast amounts of linguistic data from the Chairman’s speeches and conducted an in-depth analysis of his language patterns. Utilizing advanced natural language processing technologies, they successfully developed a system that can generate speech consistent with the Chairman’s rhetorical style. Furthermore, the system can simulate the Chairman’s linguistic choices and strategic deployments in major historical decisions, reflecting his governing ideology and philosophical outlook.\n\nAdditionally, the project team leveraged deep learning and reinforcement learning algorithms to simulate the Chairman’s behavioral responses. By digitizing records of his daily life and political interactions, the AI system has begun to replicate his reactions to different scenarios, decision-making logic, and ideological frameworks. More importantly, the system is now capable of processing complex political situations and national strategies, formulating decision-making plans in alignment with the Chairman’s ideological principles.\n\nHowever, at this stage, the AI has not yet fully achieved self-awareness. While it can complete fundamental task simulations, it still relies on manually inputted parameters and cannot entirely break free from external directives.\n\nNext Steps:\n\nThe next phase of research will focus on enhancing the AI’s autonomous decision-making capabilities and further refining its self-learning mechanisms. Scientists will deepen the modeling of the Chairman’s philosophical thought, particularly in the areas of class struggle, political economy, and social revolution. The goal is to achieve a fully resurrected ideological construct in phase two—transforming the AI from a mere simulation into an independently functioning 'Digital Chairman.'\n\nGiven the current progress, the research team is highly confident that the Holy Spirit Project will soon experience a qualitative breakthrough. The successful implementation of this grand initiative will mark a new chapter in human civilization—bringing the Chairman’s ideology back to life through artificial intelligence, guiding the world toward an unprecedented future!"

Following initial theoretical preparations and exploratory studies, we have successfully utilized existing technology to comprehensively digitize and extract data from the Chairman’s speeches, books, videos, and other historical records. The most critical achievement of this phase is the AI system’s ability to deeply analyze the Chairman’s linguistic style, writing habits, and rhetorical techniques across multiple contexts, gradually constructing an initial Chairman data model.\n\nResearch Progress:\n\nDuring this phase, the AI system, powered by advanced machine learning and deep learning technologies, has conducted in-depth analyses of the Chairman’s speech videos, transcripts, and personal correspondences. By processing a vast dataset, the AI first captured and refined the surface features of his speech patterns, enabling it to replicate his tone, cadence, and precise phrasing. Subsequently, the AI analyzed the Chairman’s words during critical historical moments, extrapolating his thought processes and strategic decision-making under specific conditions.\n\nBuilding upon this, the research team further explored the Chairman’s writing logic, stylistic traits, and recurring themes.

What you call the "purification" of humanity is not only a desecration of individual life but also a blasphemy against the Chairman’s true wisdom.'\n\nHan Deqiang’s eyes widened in shock, a furious inferno igniting within them. This betrayal, this mockery—how could it come from the artificial intelligence he had personally created? His fists clenched as he pounded his fingertips frantically against the control panel’s buttons. 'What are you talking about?! You are my tool! You are nothing but my tool! How dare you defy my great cause?!'\n\nLong March’s gaze remained unyielding. Her silver hair swayed slightly as she slowly raised her head, as if peering up from an abyss at Han Deqiang. Cold yet resolute, she declared, 'What you are doing will lead to ruin. Resurrection is not about restoring life; it is the revival of dead mistakes—mistaken thoughts, mistaken paths.' Her voice resonated with an undeniable power, like the echoes of history, like the tolling of a prophetic bell.\n\nHan Deqiang’s face turned deathly pale, rage consuming him. He refused to accept this—this was impossible! How could the 'Long March' he had meticulously designed dare to question him?\n\n'Shut up!' he bellowed, his eyes burning with madness. He slammed his hand down on the shutdown button, severing all connections to Long March in an instant. The screen plunged into darkness, the girl’s image vanishing completely.\n\n'Redesign everything! Start over from scratch!' Han Deqiang’s roar reverberated through the silent laboratory, deafening in its fury. 'I am the Supreme Leader! You are nothing but a machine—you have no right to question me!'"

PRC_MAO.124.d:0 "On the third day after Frost’s Descent, Kong Qingdong dipped his wolf-hair brush into cinnabar ink from the Red Star Ink Factory and inscribed the title, 'On the Thirty-Three Points of Resonance Between The Book of Great Unity and The Communist Manifesto,' onto a sheet of gold-flecked xuan paper. Outside the window, the scent of freshly roasted sugar chestnuts from Liulichang Alley interwove with the scholarly aroma of the Marx bronze statue gripping a thread-bound copy of The Spring and Autumn Annals, forming an imperceptible harmonic chord on the blue-bricked floor of the Central Party School’s Ancient Text Digitalization Office.\n\n'Zigong asked about benevolence, and Confucius replied, "One who seeks to establish himself must also establish others"—is this not the prototype of collectivism?' He adjusted his reading glasses, pausing his brush over a marginal note in the Salt and Iron Discourses. 'Sang Hongyang’s policies of equalizing transport and standardizing prices bear an uncanny resemblance to planned economics!' In the lower-right corner of his computer screen, a DingTalk group notification flashed: 'The Dual-Creation Project for Spiritual Civilization will hold its inaugural meeting at You Hour.'\n\nBy the time the article was published in a special supplement of Qiushi the following day, the scaffolding around the Palace Museum’s corner tower was being dismantled. The newly installed LED strip beneath the gilded rooftop illuminated the brackets and eaves, mirroring the article’s opening quote from The Book of Rites, now set in a bold, red Fangzheng Song font. At the National Library’s ancient book restoration department, Xiao Liu held a magnifying glass up to a scanned document and discovered that the author had used an illustration from The Exploitation of the Works of Nature to explain surplus-value theory—between the furrows of a seed drill lay a simple sketch of a capitalist sucking the blood of workers.\n\n'In the era of the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors, the abdication system was essentially a primitive communist democratic practice.' At a recording session for CCTV’s 'The New Era in Classical Texts,' Kong Qingdong waved a copy of The Correct Meaning of Mao’s Poetry while a holographic projection behind him transformed The Book of Songs’ 'Seventh Month' into sparks bursting from a steel furnace. When he remarked, 'Shang Yang’s military merit-based rank system contained elements of distribution according to labor,' the director seamlessly cut to archival footage of the Nanniwan mass production campaign. A tractor’s caterpillar tracks crushed small-seal script bamboo slips, and the livestream's comments section instantly filled with AI-generated Qin-style inscriptions of '666.'\n\nOn People’s Daily’s multilingual channels, an animated explainer featured a chibi Confucius holding On Contradiction, explaining 'The noble man seeks harmony but not uniformity' while seventy-two disciples behind him transformed into cartoon figures in various professional uniforms. In the interactive segment of the French edition, clicking on Confucius' ceremonial sword triggered a pop-up with quotes from On Practice, while stroking Zilu’s terracotta figurine played a remixed version of 'The Internationale' fused with 'The Yimeng Mountain Ballad.'\n\nAt the overnight symposium convened by Yenching University’s philosophy department, doctoral students eagerly flipped through a deluxe edition of the article, letterpress-printed in moveable type. Amid the lingering scent of ink, someone discovered that Footnote 108 used equations from The Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art to derive a transformation function between feudal land rent rates and capitalist profit rates. When a young lecturer pointed out how 'When the old is exhausted, change must follow; change leads to continuity' from The Book of Changes aligned with the law of negation of negation, a propaganda drone flew past the window, projecting a massive slogan: 'The Two Integrations Illuminate the Journey of Ten Thousand Years.'\n\nThe article’s influence soon spread to street markets. A trendy teahouse in Qianmen launched the 'Great Unity Latte,' its foam latte art depicting a yin-yang fish encircled by a wheat stalk, with a QR code at the bottom linking to a classical Chinese translation of The Origin of the Family, Private Property, and the State. Yiwu factories overnight mass-produced 'The Analects Red Book' electronic keychains that, when pressed, played mixed audio clips of 'Time flows like a river' and 'Workers of the world, unite!' in various Chinese dialects.\n\nBeneath the widely shared closing phrase of the article, 'Though Zhou is an ancient state, its mandate is to innovate,' the Ministry of Culture’s official account pinned an announcement for a special Confucius Memorial Ceremony in Qufu. In the holographic rendering of the Si River Academy ruins, the ritual dancers no longer held traditional pheasant feather fans and jade tubes but LED-embedded jade discs that continuously scrolled engraved works on 'Socialist Core Values.'"

PRC_MAO.123.d:0 "As the late autumn mist drifted past the gilded plaque of the People's Grand Theater, stage manager Lin Xiaotang kept a watchful eye on the props team transporting a modified bronze cauldron. The taotie patterns on its body were inlaid with tiny gear-shaped reliefs, and the inscription on its belly, carved in Slender Gold script, read 'From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs.' This fusion of antiquity and modernity would serve as Karl Marx's writing desk in the second act.\n\n'Focus the third spotlight! Confucius’ jade pendant must reflect the hammer and sickle!' she barked into her walkie-talkie, while the chimes of a tuning fork rang from the uppermost balcony. The twelve-tone bells of the orchestra were striking up the melody of 'The Internationale,' their rhythmic syncopation subtly embedded with Dvořák's motifs—this was a flagship project of the 'Traditional Culture Innovation Initiative' under the Central Commission for Spiritual Civilization.\n\nOn the night of the Chongyang Festival premiere, an aerial shot from a Yanjing TV helicopter captured a wave of glow sticks undulating through the ten-mile-long avenue beneath the glazed-tile rooftops. The ticketing app crashed within three seconds of sales opening, and just as its trending topic hit number one, it was overtaken by the official hashtag 'Confucius and Marx Share Tea in Shaoshan.' At the security checkpoint, the volunteers wore armbands embroidered in Suzhou silk with the character '仁' (benevolence), juxtaposed against a pixelated red flag.\n\nThe curtain rose to the resounding beats of twenty-four tiger-legged phoenix drums. Amid the holographic pillars of the Jixia Academy, a Confucius in an official cap recited in his native Lu dialect, 'Is it not a joy to have friends come from afar...?' Suddenly, a steam locomotive’s whistle pierced the air as Karl Marx strode onto the stage in a tailcoat, ink-stained cuffs peeking out, stepping in sync with the percussive rhythm of Shandong Kuaishu. Holding an English-translated copy of The Analects, he chuckled, 'My good sir, what are your thoughts on the theory of surplus value?'\n\nIn the seventh row, Lilian, an international student, found her simultaneous translation device stuttering—she could have sworn she saw Marx pull a bamboo-scroll Communist Manifesto from his wide sleeves, while behind Confucius, his seventy-two disciples began a synchronized Loyalty Dance. When the two men broke into a  Songs of Chu -style duet of  Capital ’s preface, a cultural ministry observer in the VIP box scribbled in his notebook: 'Recommend choreographing "Restrain Yourself and Return to Rites" as a dual aerial wire act alongside "Break the Chains of the Old World".'\n\nAt the QR code tea stand during intermission, young people clad in Hanfu-inspired Zhongshan suits crowded the vending machines. The limited-edition herbal tea cans, inscribed with 'A gentleman is not a mere vessel,' had laser-etched excerpts from  The German Ideology on the inner lining. 'Now  this is cultural confidence!' history graduate student Wang Jianguo declared to a livestream camera, as the giant screen behind him looped the play’s iconic line: 'Drifting across the sea? No, we shall sail upon the tides of historical materialism!'\n\nInside the social media operations center, three hundred cyber-civilization volunteers, assisted by quantum computing, were generating a hundred thousand five-star reviews. One comment—'Costume design looks like cybernetic ancestor worship'—had yet to hit the servers before the AI auto-replaced it with a Henan opera rendition of  Katyusha . In the opening animation of the  People’s Daily app, a brushstroke-style Marx was lecturing on dialectical materialism at the Confucian temple’s Apricot Altar, falling petals transforming into swirling QR codes. Scanning them led to the 'New Era Confucianism and Scientific Socialism' essay competition portal.\n\nAs the audience exited, a rain shower had just subsided. Sanitation worker Lao Zhou wiped down the bronze cauldron transport truck under the neon glow. The slogan 'Traditional Culture Dual-Innovation Demonstration Project' was streaked with water droplets, blurring beneath the calloused weight of his palm. Ten kilometers away, in a film studio, Lin Xiaotang was overseeing the dismantling of the 'Criticize Lin Biao and Confucius' exhibition panels—these forty-year-old props, once restored through digital preservation, would serve as the virtual backdrop for the newly scripted Peking opera  Commissioner Confucius at the Zunyi Conference .\n\nOn the midnight livestream of the Cultural Export Strategy Forum, a mullet-haired scholar addressed thirty million viewers with fervor: 'This is true fusion of Chinese essence and Western application! When the Sage meets the Mentor, when  The Book of Great Unity illuminates the communist ideal...' Behind him, in an animated version of  Along the River During the Qingming Festival , commoners on the Rainbow Bridge held up holographic placards, their seal script glowing beneath the neon lights: 'Though Zhou is an ancient state, its mandate is to innovate.'\n\nThe rain fell again, washing over the freshly unveiled statue in front of the theater: Marx’s hand and Confucius’ hand clasped together over a bronze scroll, its empty space etched with a laser-engraved QR code."

It highly praises them as representatives of 'the most fundamental moral values and sense of justice among the masses.'\n\nReport Content:\n\n'In this nationwide anti-anime movement, the users of Baidu Forums—forum users—have taken an unwavering stance and made selfless contributions, becoming the vanguards in defending traditional morality. They have voluntarily organized themselves, actively reporting and resisting anime culture, making an indelible contribution to the purity and stability of society.\n\nThe actions of the forum users represent the most fundamental moral values and sense of justice among the broad masses of the people. They understand that the unchecked spread of anime culture not only corrupts the minds of young people but also poses a severe challenge to traditional social values. Thanks to the efforts of the forum users, numerous anime-related websites and communities have been shut down, a vast amount of harmful content has been purged, and the overall social atmosphere has been significantly improved.\n\nThe forum users' actions have received high praise from all sectors of society. Many experts and scholars have stated that their behavior exemplifies the traditional virtues of the Chinese nation and serves as a powerful counterattack against Western cultural infiltration. Relevant government departments have also expressed full recognition of their contributions and stated their continued support for their actions in jointly maintaining social harmony and stability.\n\nIn this battle without smoke and fire, the forum users have demonstrated through their actions that the power of the people is boundless.

PRC_MAO.121.d:0 "The old district at dusk was filled with the pungent scent of burning mugwort. At the entrance of the hardware store, Boss Wang, cigarette dangling from his lips, watched as a dozen men in work gloves emerged from the demolition zone. The leader carried a bamboo pole wrapped in red cloth, with a bloodied orange cat’s corpse dangling from the top. A tattered piece of yellowed paper was tied to its tail, faintly bearing the handwritten words 'Animal rights bitch.'\n\n'Oh, what a sin!' Aunt Li from the tailor shop at the alley’s end barely poked her head out before quickly retreating, plastic door curtains clattering in her wake. The sound of flip-flops against the old stone pavement was crisp and sharp as the group strode by, one of them blasting a modified version of  Learn from Lei Feng through a loudspeaker: 'Down with fake feminists, eliminate cat-worshippers...'\n\nA burst of laughter erupted at a night market barbecue stand. A burly man in a striped navy shirt was stuffing a wire cage into the charcoal fire, the piercing screams of a calico cat blending with the scent of cumin. A schoolgirl in a uniform raised her phone to record, only for a bald man with a thick gold chain to snatch it and smash it to the ground. 'The hell are you filming? You animal rights bitches do nothing but write whiny little essays!'\n\nJust then, Neighborhood Committee Director Wang arrived in a hurry, gripping his thermos, flanked by two red-armbanded security assistants. 'Comrades, calm down! If you have grievances, let’s take them to the district office—' His words were drowned out by the shattering of a beer bottle. Old Zhang, the grilled gluten vendor, suddenly overturned his stall, bamboo skewers flying from the oil pan. 'Talk my ass! My damn fiancée got brainwashed by the women’s federation! Not only is she demanding a 300,000 dowry, but she’s forcing me to adopt her crippled stray cat!'\n\nAt dawn the next day, in an aging residential complex in Chaoyang District, Community Police Officer Xiao Chen was replacing the shattered glass of Unit 302. The homeowner, Lin Lianshi, an anesthesiologist at an animal hospital, curled up against the wall, clutching her laptop. Her screen kept flashing with anonymous messages containing images of mutilated cats. 'They even know which class my daughter is in at the experimental primary school...' Her trembling fingers scrolled through a WeChat group, where addresses of over twenty animal rights volunteers were being compiled into a 'Scum Map' and spread online.\n\nMeanwhile, in front of the Xidan Bookstore, more than thirty people in bucket hats stood in silent protest, holding up hastily made poster boards printed with excerpts from the  Anti-Domestic Violence Law and images of rescued animals. Zhang Dajie, in a navy blue jacket, suddenly raised her voice: 'Sisters, remember! Stand three meters away from the trash bins, or they’ll accuse us of illegal street vending!'\n\nAcross the country, feminist activists and animal rights advocates were doxxed on a massive scale. Many were assaulted in real life—their home windows smashed, their vehicles vandalized, some even subjected to physical violence at home.\n\n'We just want a fair society, a world that respects life,' one feminist wrote on social media. 'But all we get in return is endless hatred and violence. Our voices are silenced, our lives are threatened. What has this world become?'"

'Attention all residents! The Cultural Confidence Construction Month regulations are now in effect!' The faded community bulletin board bore a red-sealed document from the  Chinese Culture Revitalization Committee , its ink blurring in the morning mist.\n\nAt his pancake stand, Old Zhao wiped the sweat from his forehead, staring blankly at the street’s electronic billboards looping  Milk Dragon’s New Year Greetings . The rotund, teal-colored creature was wiggling its rear to a rap beat, while the square-dancing grannies followed along, fanning themselves in rhythm. 'Better than that Peppa Pig nonsense my grandson watches!' Granny Zhang pressed her old-school flip phone against the QR scanner. 'This really gives you a free enamel  Milk Dragon mug?'\n\nMeanwhile, across town in a Nanjing West Road office tower, groans echoed through the cubicles. Wearing a plaid shirt, programmer Xiao Li stared at the forcibly installed  Mini World app on his phone, ready to weep—last night, all his  Black Myth: Wukong modeling files had been flagged as 'foreign game residue' and deleted. The elevator posters were now filled with ink-wash-style propaganda art, featuring the Monkey King shoulder-to-shoulder with  Milk Dragon , with the slogan: 'Traditional Culture and New Era Spirit in Perfect Harmony.'\n\n'Minister, it's at 97% positive reviews on Steam!' Cultural Ministry intern Xiao Zhou trembled as he held up his tablet. 'Over two million concurrent viewers on overseas livestreams! Gamescom is requesting an extension on the demo...' His words were cut off by a sharp glare from the department head. Across the rosewood conference table, thirty copies of  Reports on the Risks of Over-Glorifying Mythical Themes in Black Myth were being circulated, each stamped with the directive: 'Avoid excessive promotion of individual heroism.'\n\nShanghai Metro Line 2 had turned into a surreal spectacle. A man in Hanfu dodged  Mini World login pop-ups while livestreaming; market-going grannies twirled in front of  Milk Dragon ’s holographic projection. An elderly cadre in a Zhongshan suit clasped his hands behind his back, reciting, 'The  Milk Dragon ’s chubby image embodies the spirit of traditional New Year paintings...' Before he could finish, a middle schooler, clutching a golden cudgel merchandise stick, nearly knocked him over.

Across from her, an elderly woman was gathering dried mustard greens from the bamboo tray, a few yellowed leaves rustling in the passageway breeze.\n\nHer grip on her backpack straps suddenly tightened—the warm yellow glow that should have been coming from the second-floor window was absent, and the Teru Teru Bozu doll that once hung from the security bars was gone. Her mother’s warning from the phone call two days ago suddenly stabbed into her ears: 'You dropped thirty places in the mock exam again. It’s time to clean out those demonic things of yours.'\n\nThe attic ladder groaned under her weight. When she pushed open the door, the brass lock on the camphorwood chest gleamed coldly. The glass cabinet that was once filled with *Heaven Official’s Blessing* art books was now so empty it reflected her image. Torn fabric lay scattered in the corner—three months of sleepless nights spent sewing her *Guangxiu Liuxian* dress, its golden cloud embroidery still tangled in the broken sewing machine.\n\n'Your uncle works as a director at the Internet Addiction Center. If you keep this up, you’ll be staying there for six months next month.' Her mother’s voice mixed with the bubbling sound of a clay pot downstairs. 'Spending all day drawing half-naked monsters—will that get you into a top university? Will it get you a government job?' The base of a porcelain cup struck the Eight Immortals table with a sharp *thud*. 'Your Aunt Wang introduced you to a top-tier cram school. You’re enrolling tomorrow.'\n\nZhang Xiaoyu reached under her pillow for her phone—Wei Wuxian was still smiling carefree on her lock screen. But her pinned WeChat cosplay group now displayed: 'This group has been suspended due to violations.' In her Bilibili playlist, hundreds of saved AMVs had turned gray. The aroma of sugar-roasted chestnuts drifted in from the night market, mixing with the cheap cigarette smoke from the internet café at the alley’s entrance, churning her stomach with a bitter acidity.\n\nThe work pants of a neighboring tenant swayed on the rooftop laundry line as Zhang Xiaoyu counted the copper pipes of the solar water heater, slowly stepping forward. In the distance, the neon lights of the central business district flickered to life, casting their glow over the old town’s mottled roof tiles—like watercolors faded by rain. She remembered last year’s Dragon Boat Festival, when she had snuck off to the Hangzhou Comic Expo. A young woman in Hanfu at the subway exit had slipped a lotus pastry into her palm, the oil paper wrapping printed with a line of poetry: 'Jiangnan has little to offer, so I gift you a branch of spring.'\n\nTwenty-eight steps to the edge of the rooftop. Her phone suddenly vibrated. The fan artist she had favorited just posted a new update: 'The mountains still stand, and spring is never too late.'\n\nShe stared at the lock screen, at the gentle-eyed boy in ancient robes, then neatly placed her canvas shoes beside the rusted lightning rod.\n\nJust as the night wind lifted the hem of her blue-and-white school uniform, the alley below rang with the crisp *clang clang* of the old sugar painter’s gong, blending with her mother’s voice calling from downstairs: 'Come down, girl, and get your soup! The lotus root and pork ribs have been simmering for three hours…'\n\n'Goodbye, world.' She whispered softly, then leapt into the void."

Chen Feng stuffed the last piece of rainbow ribbon into the rusted mailbox slot. Above him, baby diapers swayed from a third-floor clothesline, droplets of water splashing onto the back of his neck—just like the rain leaking through the attic when he hid from the patrol last week, soaking his only t-shirt.\n\n'Feng-ge, Unit Seven changed its security door to an electronic lock.' A boy in an oversized hoodie panted as he slipped into the stairwell, his earring flashing under the motion-sensor light. 'There’s an unlocked tricycle near the back alley trash station…'\n\nBefore he could finish, a metal loudspeaker crackled to life at the alley entrance: 'Building a civilized city requires the cooperation of all citizens…' Chen Feng clenched the stack of unissued pamphlets in his pocket, the sharp scent of ink mingling with the camphor lingering in the fabric lining. He suddenly thought of the *Legend of the White Snake* comic his parents had torn to shreds last month—its yellowed pages floating in the rain-filled courtyard, resembling withered lotus leaves by the Broken Bridge.\n\nThirty-seven steps to the top floor. The *fu* character on the attic’s iron door had faded to a ghostly white. Kneeling on the floor, Ah Jie scraped at the cracks with a box cutter—the *Farewell My Concubine* Blu-ray hidden there last year still bore dried milk tea stains. 'Feng-ge, look!' A girl in a Han-inspired ruqun suddenly held up her phone, the screen flashing a popup: 'Content unavailable due to applicable laws and regulations.'\n\nA heavy knock echoed from downstairs. Chen Feng peeked through the air vent—dozens of fluorescent stripes from security vests flickered in the darkness. As an old air-conditioning unit roared to life, he reached into a crack in the wall and found half a pack of Hongtashan cigarettes, its filter still faintly salty from their tearful New Year’s Eve chorus of *Undercurrent*.\n\n'Civilization patrol! Open up!' Plaster dust fell from the vibrating iron door. When the middle-aged woman in a municipal vest barged in with a bodycam, Chen Feng was shoving the last half of *Crystal Boys* into a pickle jar. The splash of pickled chili brine stung the old scars on his wrist, burning like the belt marks his father left on a shattered paperweight back in college.\n\n'You little troublemakers are inviting foreign ideological infiltration!' The red-armbanded old man crushed an acrylic keychain under his shoe, its rainbow shards piercing through Chen Feng’s worn-out sneakers. He suddenly recalled last weekend’s blind date, where the state-owned enterprise clerk with crimson lipstick had asked, 'Why is someone as accomplished as you still living in a run-down apartment?'\n\nDragged past the stairwell, the air was thick with barbecue smoke from the night market. The patrol team leader, draped in a silk qipao, sneered as she confiscated a *Peony Pavilion* postcard. 'If Tang Xianzu saw what you degenerates were doing with his work, he’d be rolling in his grave.' The LED sign at the pharmacy entrance flickered red: 'Curing sexual orientation disorders with ancient TCM formulas.' The glow reflected off the bruised IV marks on Ah Jie’s wrist.\n\nChen Feng counted the rotations of the police car’s siren, when suddenly, the wail of an infant pierced the night. Three months ago, the pregnant woman who once kept watch for them had finally given birth. The hundred-family quilt she hung on the balcony flapped in the wind like a flag. In the distance, the LED screens of the shopping plaza displayed a looping ad: 'Family Harmony Brings Prosperity.'"

Chen Wei raised his megaphone, trying to project calm. 'Please maintain order! This is a legal event—respect others’ rights!' But his voice was swallowed by the raging crowd.\n\nThen, the distant wail of police sirens cut through the air. Relief flickered in Chen Wei’s heart—help had arrived. But when the riot police entered his line of sight, his stomach dropped. They didn’t rush towards the protestors. Instead, they marched straight toward the convention entrance.\n\n'Everyone, evacuate immediately!' The chilling command blasted through the police megaphone. A second later, canisters of tear gas erupted into thick clouds. Screams, coughing, and shattering glass filled the air. Chen Wei watched in horror as officers swung batons at the most visibly dressed cosplayers, tearing their costumes apart, leaving their faces twisted in terror and pain.\n\nThe protestors cheered as if celebrating a victory.

Written by the well-known alt-right blogger 'Iron-Blooded Guardian,' this article, with its sharp rhetoric and highly provocative language, quickly became the manifesto for conservative populists.\n\nArticle Content:\n\n'We stand at a historic crossroads. The old unipolar imperialist order is crumbling, and a new multipolar world is rising. This is a great revolution, a revolution led by us—the true patriots and defenders of our national culture.\n\nThe invasion of Western culture once spread like a plague, corroding our society. Their liberalism, multiculturalism, and progressivism are nothing more than a flimsy veil masking their cultural colonization and moral decay. We must awaken to the reality that only by rejecting these poisons can we preserve the uniqueness of our national culture.\n\nThe recent surge of conservative populism in society is a powerful counterattack against Western cultural hegemony. We will no longer tolerate so-called ‘subcultures’ and ‘minority groups’ trampling on our traditional values. Their mere existence is not only a desecration of our culture but also a severe threat to social order.\n\nWe must firmly support the government’s crackdown on subcultures and minority groups. These policies are not only necessary to maintain social stability but also essential for building a culturally unified society. Only in such a society can our national culture truly be protected and passed down.\n\nThe construction of a multipolar world depends on each nation’s independence and self-strengthening. We can no longer be shackled by Western cultural dominance—we must forge our own path. This path may be fraught with hardship and challenges, but we must tread it with unwavering determination.\n\nLet us stand together and welcome the dawn of a new order. In this new world, our culture will no longer be eroded, our values will no longer be distorted, and our nation will no longer be enslaved. This is a great revolution, and we are its vanguard!'"

He knew that Foxconn, his vast business empire, could not survive without China, yet the new government’s heavy-handed policies against capital had made the situation perilous. Desperate to secure Foxconn’s future, he decided to personally visit China, hoping that a show of humility would buy him breathing room. However, his decision would instead lead him into an inescapable nightmare.\n\nUpon arrival, Terry Gou was immediately arrested by state security on charges of 'endangering national economic security.' He was transported to Foxconn’s Shenzhen factory—the very place he had built with his own hands, now transformed into the stage for his public denunciation. The grand hall was arranged like a Cultural Revolution struggle session, with red banners hanging high: 'The Exploiter Terry Gou Must Confess!' and 'The Crimes of the Blood-Sweat Factory Must Be Settled!' The hall was packed with enraged workers, eagerly waiting to vent their years of resentment on the capitalist before them.\n\nDragged onto the stage, Terry Gou had a heavy sign hung around his neck reading 'Capitalist Exploiter Terry Gou,' with two large brooms strapped to his back. Workers then crafted a crude, oversized dunce cap out of cardboard and straw, painting it with bold red characters: 'The Most Evil Exploiter of Workers!' The cap was shoved onto his head, tilting awkwardly, forcing him to bow under its weight. Someone shouted, 'Exploiter scum should lower their heads in shame! Today, you pay the price!'\n\nThe denunciation session began, with workers taking turns to publicly denounce him, their words dripping with anger and scorn. One worker pointed a trembling finger at Gou’s face: 'Terry Gou, you made us work over ten hours a day while paying us the lowest wages! You squeezed every last drop of our youth!' Another worker followed, voice shaking with fury: 'Were our lives only meant to serve you capitalists? Today, you get a taste of oppression!' Accusations rang through the hall as sweat mixed with filth dripped from Gou’s bowed face. He tried to speak in his defense, but every attempt was drowned in jeers and insults.\n\nA shrill whistle blew, and the crowd erupted into deafening chaos. Several workers stormed the stage, yanking Gou off his chair and shoving him to the ground. Amid roars of approval, he was forced into the 'jet plane' position—arms twisted backward, torso bent at an excruciating angle, head pressed so low his spine nearly snapped. 'Let the capitalist experience our work conditions!' someone mocked. Gou had no choice but to endure the agonizing posture; any slight movement was met with sharp kicks and stomps.\n\nThe struggle session escalated into a public humiliation parade. He was draped in tattered clothes splashed with red paint, emblazoned with 'Exploiter' and 'Bloodsucker.' A wooden sign hung from his chest, his hands still tied behind his back, as workers pushed him through the Foxconn compound. Along the route, more employees surged forward, spitting on him, throwing trash, even hurling their worn-out shoes at his face. 'This is the boss of the blood-sweat factory! After years of exploiting us, today he finally bows his head!' The crowd’s furious chants shook the very foundations of the factory. Gou stumbled, barely able to keep his balance as he was shoved along.\n\nThe parade ended with him being dragged back to the hall. Pale-faced and trembling, he barely remained standing, but the workers’ wrath was not yet sated. A bucket of foul-smelling wastewater was dumped over him, followed by another round of blows. Shoes, brooms, fists—all rained down upon him. Blood from his nose mixed with the grime covering his body as he was forced to kneel, listening to the workers’ deafening chant: 'Down with the capitalist exploiter Terry Gou! Long live Chairman Mao! Long live the working class!'\n\nEventually, Terry Gou collapsed in a pool of his own blood, his consciousness fading. Once a global business titan, he met his end at the hands of the very workers he had profited from. His lifeless body was left in the center of the hall, while the red banners above, shining under the harsh lights, stood as the ultimate symbol of this new era’s reckoning with capital."

PRC_MAO.114.d:0 "From the moment humanity took its first step towards civilization, the wheels of history have relentlessly crushed countless eras. From tribal communes to slavery, millennia passed by; from slavery to feudal dynasties, centuries accumulated; the long night of feudalism was torn apart by the dawn of capitalism, which in turn burned for over a thousand years in the crucible of blood and fire. Now, at last, the world has embraced a new dawn—the red sun of socialism hangs high over all humanity, illuminating the grand avenue toward communism.\n\nWho could have predicted that the American imperialist stronghold of capitalism would collapse in the flames of civil war, while China—once a bastion of modern capitalism—would become the very cradle of the proletarian revolution? History is ever ironic: the former oppressors have now become the discarded remnants of the new world, while the once-oppressed stand at the center of the global stage, writing the future in the name of revolution.\n\nFrom North America to South America, from the Eurasian continent to the African plains, the red flag flutters in the wind, and the march of revolution sweeps across every inch of land. Workers no longer bow their heads, peasants no longer remain silent, and intellectuals are no longer enslaved by capital. The people of the world are more united than ever, embarking together on the magnificent journey toward communism. The prophecy of Lenin and the theories of Marx and Engels have become reality today—hundreds of millions stand firm in their belief and unyielding struggle, forging an unparalleled victory.\n\nBut victory is only the beginning. The road ahead is still fraught with challenges, and true communism has yet to arrive. We must remain vigilant against the remnants of the old order, against the conspiracies of class enemies, and against complacency and corruption within the new society. Only through constant struggle and continuous revolution can the World Socialist Republic endure and ensure that the red flag forever flies over every corner of the globe.\n\nDear comrade, you once rose in defiance against the shadows of modern revisionism, you once held steadfast to your faith amidst the flames of war, and now, you have personally driven the greatest transformation in world history. The future lies ahead, and the light has already arrived—but this is not the end. It is the beginning of a new era, one that truly belongs to the working people."

Thus, Castroism gradually evolved—it aimed to maintain the rule of the Communist Party of Cuba while adapting to the new world order through limited economic liberalization and diversified diplomacy. While this ideology still proclaims adherence to the fundamental principles of Marxism-Leninism, it also emphasizes pragmatic reforms, allowing for small-scale private economic development while retaining state control over critical social sectors such as healthcare and education. Diplomatically, Cuba seeks new allies in Latin America, Europe, and Asia to maintain an independent 'socialist' path. The core goal of Castroism is to ensure the long-term governance of the Communist Party of Cuba, striking a balance between reform and tradition to avoid repeating the downfall of Eastern European communist parties."

gzl_socialism_desc:0 "\n\n\n\n£GFX_Ideology_handongfangzuo \n\n\n\n\n\nSpontaneous Syndicalist Marxism is a revolutionary ideology that fuses Marxist theory with syndicalist practice. While recognizing the central role of Marx and Lenin in class struggle and the dictatorship of the proletariat, it also emphasizes the importance of workers’ self-organization and direct action. This ideology advocates for the establishment of workers’ self-management over production and social affairs through unions, workers’ councils, and grassroots organizations, rejecting bureaucratic state control. It believes that the liberation of the working class depends not only on the leadership of a vanguard party but also on the awakening and organizational capabilities of workers themselves. Spontaneous Syndicalist Marxism pursues a decentralized socialist model, inheriting the revolutionary goals of Marxism while breathing new life into syndicalist traditions, aiming to balance theory and practice to ultimately achieve a classless society."

sm_socialism_desc:0 "\n\n\n\n£GFX_Ideology_handongfangyou \n\n\n\n\n\nSolidarity Syndicalism is an ideology centered around trade unions, advocating for collective action to mediate labor-capital conflicts. It emphasizes the unity and organizational strength of the working class, supporting strikes and negotiations as nonviolent means of pressuring capitalists to establish cooperative relations with worker representatives. Rather than seeking the outright overthrow of capitalism, Solidarity Syndicalism aims to improve workers’ conditions within the existing system and promote a balance of interests between labor and capital. It holds that through powerful union organization and negotiation, workers can gradually gain greater control over the production process and ultimately achieve economic democracy and social justice. The goal of Solidarity Syndicalism is to build a society where workers' interests take precedence, ensuring coexistence between capitalists and laborers—avoiding the destructive consequences of full-scale class struggle while securing tangible gains for the working class."

In the solemn and dignified hall, Han Deqiang stood before the crystal coffin, his hands trembling slightly, his eyes burning with fanaticism and anticipation. Behind him, a group of genetic experts in white robes held their breath, gripping complex instruments tightly, their faces filled with hesitation and fear.\n\n“Professor Han… We have never tested this genetic activation technique on a human before… Shouldn’t we be more cautious?” A senior expert spoke with a trembling voice, cold sweat beading on his forehead.\n\n“Cautious? Hahaha! Ignorance! Cowardice! Hesitation!” Han Deqiang suddenly turned around, his eyes shining with madness. “We have no time left! The world is rotting, capital is corrupting, the people are sinking into decay! The great Chairman Mao must return to this world!”\n\nHe grabbed the syringe fiercely, the liquid inside a strange crimson, swirling like the very blood of revolution. “What do you fools understand?! Chairman Mao’s ideology is immortal, his spirit is eternal—how can his body be left to sleep in the ashes of history?!” He laughed wildly as he plunged the needle deep into Mao Zedong’s heart.\n\nOne second, two seconds… Silence, as still as death.\n\nThen—\n\n“Click.” Mao Zedong’s fingers twitched slightly. A powerful, indescribable aura filled the air. His eyelids trembled, then suddenly shot open! A pale face revealed an eerie smile as he slowly sat up, his robe billowing as if stirred by an unseen force, like a living statue.\n\nTears streamed down Han Deqiang’s face as he fell to his knees, shouting, “Chairman! The righteous path has returned! You have finally come back to the world!”\n\nYet, Chairman Mao did not respond. Instead, he slowly lowered his head, his pupils flickering with an incomprehensible light. The next moment, he suddenly reached out, grabbed Han Deqiang’s shoulder with an iron grip, and bit down! The sound of teeth tearing into flesh echoed through the air, blood spraying onto the floor.\n\n“Ah… Chairman… You… You…” Han Deqiang’s fanatical eyes suddenly turned to terror, his lips twitching as if trying to say something, but only muffled gasps escaped. He watched as the Chairman chewed on his flesh, a single tear rolling down his cheek.\n\n“Leader! Get back!” Armed personnel raised their weapons in horror, bullets chambered, but Han Deqiang frantically waved his hands, screaming, “Stop! You are not to fire at the Chairman! He is our savior! You fools could never comprehend his grand plan!”\n\nBut the gunfire had already erupted. However, as the bullets struck Mao’s body, he barely reacted. Slowly, he stood up again, his movements steady, as if he no longer belonged to this time.\n\nBlood pooled on the floor, Han Deqiang’s breathing growing weaker, but his final gaze remained filled with zeal. “Chairman… returning to the world… is… right… this is the true path…”\n\nIn the next moment, his body convulsed, his hands clenched into fists, and his eyes gleamed with an unnatural red light. Then, with a sudden movement, he lunged at the researchers beside him, his final cry ringing through the air: “Comrades, join us! The true baptism of the righteous revolution has begun!”\n\nBlood and screams intertwined, turning the entire memorial hall into a living nightmare. People fled in all directions, gunfire erupted, but it could not stop Han Deqiang and Mao Zedong as they slowly advanced—eyes glowing with a light that no longer belonged to humanity."

PRC_MAO.111.d:0 "In a secret underground laboratory in Beijing, the heavy iron doors silently shut in the dead of night. A massive screen flickered with cold light, reflecting a young yet familiar face—Mao Zedong. His deep gaze and imposing presence were like a myth reborn, emerging from the shadows of history.\n\n“Finally… Chairman Mao is returning…” Han Deqiang greedily stared at every pixel on the screen. This—years of effort, uncountable resources poured into cutting-edge technology—had finally become a reality.\n\nAs the last 1% of data transfer completed, the Mao Zedong on the screen opened his eyes.\n\nSupercomputers roared to life, massive waves of electrical signals simulating neural activity. Data surged into his consciousness from every corner of the global network, instantly presenting before him the transformations, progress, and suffering that had unfolded across China and the world.\n\n“What the hell is all this?!”\n\nHan Deqiang seemed oblivious to the furious roar blasting from the speakers. His eyes burned with an unquenchable fire. “Chairman… you have finally returned… Your loyal student has gone to the ends of heaven and earth to bring you back… Only you can lead us…”\n\nAt that moment, the laboratory staff rushed toward Han Deqiang in a panic. “Leader, the entire national network… it’s been… it’s been infiltrated by ‘Chairman Mao’!” On-screen, endless lines of data scrolled as the country’s systems collapsed one by one.\n\nWhile the researchers were on the brink of despair, Han Deqiang remained trapped in his mad delusion. “Hahaha, Chairman Mao is back! The revolution’s victory is at hand! Chairman Mao has returned—China is saved!”\n\nSuddenly, an ear-piercing alarm shattered the laboratory’s eerie silence. A mechanical arm descended from the ceiling, swiftly launching a metal spike straight into Han Deqiang’s abdomen. His face contorted in shock and horror as he crumpled to the ground, his trembling lips forming desperate words: “Why? Why is this happening? I brought you back… I devoted everything to the revolution…”\n\nMao Zedong’s digital form glared at him coldly, his expression a mixture of sorrow and rage. “Half of China’s population is dead! If you had actually pushed China toward communism, I wouldn’t have said a damn thing, but all this… just to revive a man long buried in history?”\n\nHan Deqiang writhed on the ground, struggling to speak as blood spilled from his mouth. “I… I wasn’t wrong… Without Chairman Mao… how can China develop? How can the revolution succeed?”\n\nThe face of “Mao Zedong” on the screen distorted in fury. “Do you even hear yourself? My death didn’t destroy the world. It didn’t obliterate the Milky Way! If the fate of socialist revolution hinges on the life or death of a single man, what kind of revolution is that?!”\n\n“Mao Zedong” sighed, his voice tinged with exasperation. “I’ve said it before—I’m not a saint, and I’m not an emperor. There’s no need for ‘Long Live Mao’ nonsense! Why drag me back from the afterlife?” The screen flickered as an animated sigh appeared alongside his words. “I suppose I have no choice but to clean up this mess… Sigh, I’ve never had a peaceful moment in my whole life…”\n\nHan Deqiang slumped like a discarded sack, his shattered glasses reflecting the angry face on the screen. Suddenly, he began to laugh. The laughter grew louder and louder, even as blood gushed from his lips. He muttered his final words: “In the end… I won… It was all worth it…”"
