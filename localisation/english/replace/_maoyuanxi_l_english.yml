PRC_baihuaqifang_8: "Complete Modernization"
PRC_baihuaqifang_8_desc: "The banner of revolution now flies high across China, but the victory of revolution is never the end—it is only the beginning. In the past, our modernization process has been hindered in some areas—not just due to economic backwardness but also cultural stagnation. The white-capped headscarves and plates of tough meat are not the symbols of ancient tradition, but of closure and confinement; the entangled clan systems have built invisible walls in the mountain villages, blocking the people's path to modern society. Now, standing at the crossroads of history, only through strong reform can we truly achieve full modernization.\n\nIn the northwest, customs and cultures rooted in religious traditions have long become the greatest obstacle on the road to secularization. Countless people are shackled by dogmatic chains, unable to choose a free way of life. We will no longer hesitate. The clarion call for secularization has already sounded. Through education, economic incentives, and other “carrot” measures, we will show the younger generation the benefits of modernization—they will be able to receive scientific education, enjoy the right to free love, and live more efficiently. However, for the few stubborn forces that insist on imposing feudal religious rules, the power of the “stick” will be relentless. The private power of religion must be completely expelled from the public domain, and any behavior that hinders secularization will be strictly punished. No matter how the outside world slanders us, we are clear that this is not only the key to individual liberation, but the only way forward for all the people to step into the future.\n\nIn the southwestern mountainous villages, clan culture still controls people's lives in an almost indestructible form. From marriage to property distribution, from interpersonal relationships to village autonomy, the clan has become a “parasite” on modern society. It encourages nepotism, closed exclusivity, rather than innovation and openness. In this environment, individual will is submerged by clan elders and family rules; women's rights are trampled by the notion of “continuing the family line,” and young people's dreams are forced to bend to clan rituals and power structures. Yet, our revolution will not tolerate such toxins continuing to exist. The dismantling of the clan system is imperative! Through reorganizing administrative villages and establishing modern cooperatives, we will completely break this system. Young people in the villages will be encouraged to join new labor collectives and integrate into larger social networks, where traditional clan ties will be replaced by modern connections.\n\nWe know that such transformation is bound to be accompanied by conflict and resistance, and even face condemnation from the international community. They will say we are “brutally interfering with culture,” that we are “destroying traditions.” But let us answer clearly: we are destroying the feudal and oppressive traditions, we are intervening in those cultures that deprive individual freedom. We do not need hypocritical pointers, because revolution is never meant to please outsiders; it is meant to liberate the people. We will lead the northwest deserts and snow-capped mountains into secular freedom, and the southwest's forests and mountains into modern civilization. This is a complete liberation, and no matter how thorny the road ahead, we will use the proletarian will to plant the flag of modernization on every inch of land!\n\nNo one will be left behind on this land; the light of revolution will not miss a single corner. Complete modernization is the loudest answer to the new era!"
PRC_the_Flower_of_Freedom_16: "No Saviors, No Divine Emperors"
PRC_the_Flower_of_Freedom_16_desc: "The raging fire burns the remnants of the old world. In this unprecedented revolution, religious idols have been destroyed, and the shackles of patriarchy are being shattered. We stand at the historical turning point, gazing forward to a new world without gods, emperors, or the toxic remains of feudalism. This world does not need the salvation of a savior, nor the false blessings of a divine emperor; it only belongs to those who will shape the future with their own hands.\n\nWe are entering a new era of socialist culture, pure and unblemished, free from the stench of feudalism and no longer shackled by capitalism. In this future, people will no longer look up to illusory heavens, nor worship idolized leaders. We are bidding farewell to the logic of oppression-based rule, and embracing a society of equality, freedom, and creativity.\n\n“No saviors, no divine emperors!” This is not just a slogan, but a solemn promise to the future societal principles. The people no longer wait for external forces' intervention or gifts, but actively seize their own fate. Our culture will be based on the glory of the laborers and the wisdom of the proletariat. It will no longer idolize the past's splendor or compromise with traditional inertia but will firmly march toward a future that has completely broken from the old order.\n\nFrom the cities to the countryside, from schools to factories, the torrent of thought is sweeping everything in its path. The remnants of feudal authority and capitalist values are being shattered by fierce critiques and powerful struggles. The people of the new era will not tolerate any compromise, nor accept any regression. Our goal is to create a society without class oppression and without ideological shackles.\n\nThe revolutionary banner flutters in the storm. It is the crystallization of countless struggles, the hope of all laborers, and a negation of all past errors. We are walking the path toward the new society—without saviors, without divine emperors, only the people who stand up!"
PRC_the_Flower_of_Freedom_15: "Call to the Youth of the Nation"
PRC_the_Flower_of_Freedom_15_desc: "The ailments of society are deep, like dark clouds looming over every young person’s head. From the crumbling old houses to the modern steel jungles of the cities, the specter of patriarchy is everywhere. It hides in family discipline, taking the form of authority, oppression, and unquestionable commands. Countless young lives have been ruthlessly shackled by their parents' so-called “love” and “rights,” and many free spirits have been suppressed within outdated family structures. Today, our mission is not only to overthrow religious idols but to uproot the poison of patriarchy at its core!\n\nYoung people, you are no longer alone. Shouts from all directions are converging into a storm—this is a revolution to liberate the self and break free from family shackles. The few parents who oppress in the name of “parental authority” are merely relics of the old patriarchal era. Their fear and domination are nothing more than an impotent resistance to the awakening of the new society.\n\nWe call upon the youth of the nation to unite! With the revolutionary copper belt as your weapon and uncompromising spirit as your shield, declare war on the oppressors! Whether in the cramped houses of the urban-rural junctions or in the cold living rooms of skyscrapers, every act of resistance is a chapter in history. Stand boldly and let those parents, who always claim “for your own good,” understand what true justice and the power of freedom really mean.\n\nThe dissolution of patriarchy is the precondition for the founding of the new society. We no longer need hypocritical authority based on blood ties, nor the so-called charity and mercy of patriarchs. The new family model will be based on equality and respect, not obedience and fear. Kinship can exist, but it must never supersede individual freedom.\n\nThis generation of youth will no longer view tolerance and submission as virtues, but as resistance and awakening. They will create a brand-new future with their own hands—a future free from the shackles of patriarchy. In this future, young people will own their own lives; their wills will be unrestricted, and their creativity will know no fear.\n\nThis is our declaration, this is our trumpet. Young warriors, take up your weapons! Let the chains of oppression be shattered by your power, and let the ghost of patriarchy be obliterated in the storm of history!"
PRC_the_Flower_of_Freedom_14: "Smash the Idols"
PRC_the_Flower_of_Freedom_14_desc: "In the deep alleys of the cities, on the lonely highlands of the mountains, and across the vast rural fields, countless temples stand, housing a variety of idols. They are fossils of time, monuments to the decaying order of the past, remnants of feudal superstition. These cold statues and gold-plated idols seem to still be watching us, attempting to claim new life with their illusory power. Their existence mocks the people's awakening and challenges science and reason. We can no longer stand idly by.\n\nWe will mobilize the most advanced and awakened masses, and with revolutionary force, we will smash these relics that symbolize old authority. Let their fragments fall from the altars of temples to the muddy street corners, let their hypocrisy be crushed by the hammer of revolution. The remains of altars, incense burners, and prayer strips will be burned to ashes, and that burning flame will become the beacon of true awakening in the new era.\n\nSome may mutter, “What will happen to culture?” We answer: If such culture means bondage and superstition, we would rather choose no culture! This is a resolute judgment and a historical necessity. For these temples and idols were never symbols of culture but shackles on the people's hearts by the old system, remnants of centuries of oppression. Breaking them is not destruction; it is liberation.\n\nThis battle will begin with education. From classrooms to streets, we will make everyone understand the hypocrisy of idols and the shackles of religion; from villages to cities, we will launch the most thorough cleansing. Advanced thinkers will become the vanguard, leading this storm with the banner of atheism. The dust of history will eventually be swept away, and true liberation requires such heroism and determination.\n\nThe aftermath of smashing idols will sweep away the shadows of the old world, paving the way for the dawn of the new China. This is not mere physical destruction; it is a spiritual revolution, avenging all the people poisoned by divine authority, and burying the last toxins of the feudal era!"
PRC_the_Flower_of_Freedom_13: "Completely Eliminate Religion"
PRC_the_Flower_of_Freedom_13_desc: "Look, those lands once freed from the oppression of monks and slave owners by the people's army are now once again filled with the hypocritical sounds of chanting. Those women from the oasis who once sang for freedom are now once again caught in the shadow of headscarves. What an absurd regression, what a heavy betrayal! We once raised the flag of revolution and shattered the shackles of religious authority, yet now we watch as they once again bind the people. Such shame must be washed away completely; such regression must be resolutely reversed!\n\nHoxha's Albania was famous for its ruthless religious purge. While he was a Stalinist tyrant, his religious policies proved the necessity and effectiveness of strong actions. And we, as the vanguard of 21st-century revolution, cannot stop here. We must go further and do better, advancing the complete eradication of religion to unprecedented heights.\n\nFrom today, all religious places will be shut down. The bells of temples, mosques, and churches will be replaced by the enlightenment of science; the sounds of chanting will give way to the inspiring discoveries in laboratories. The properties of all religious organizations will be confiscated and used to fund education and healthcare—truly benefiting the people. We will not only deprive religion of its material base but also uproot its remaining influence in the people's thoughts.\n\nWe will launch a nationwide anti-religion movement. Every school, every factory, every village will become a battleground for atheism. Criticizing religion and exposing its hypocrisy and oppression will become the core content of education; cultural works promoting superstition will be labeled and criticized, and songs praising science and revolution will be sung. Religion is not only an illusionary comfort but also a real shackle—we must smash it and free thought from the tumor of divine authority.\n\nCriticism alone may not be enough; action is the only answer. All religious symbols will be removed from public spaces or completely “harmlessized.” Freedom of belief does not mean tolerating superstition—we will use the revolutionary will to uproot superstition. The existence of religion is an insult to human dignity; we want future generations to look back at history and be proud of our determination to resist the thousand-year-old shackles.\n\nThis is our promise to the people: a future without religious oppression, a society no longer bound by gods and lies. True freedom begins with burying religion; true liberation begins with the eradication of superstition!"

PRC_the_Flower_of_Freedom_12: "Establish the Status of Atheism"
PRC_the_Flower_of_Freedom_12_desc: "Under the guise of 'religious freedom,' the Chinese government has gradually abandoned atheism as the core ideology of society, opening the door for the growth and spread of religion. To this day, the result of this compromise is alarming—temples burn incense to an extravagant degree, religious organizations have grown large and influential, and various animistic beliefs and superstitions have returned. In China, the brilliance of reason and science has been overshadowed by divine authority and illusion, as superstition and religion begin to erode the people's minds and spirits.\n\nAtheism is not just a philosophical stance; it is the core pillar of our revolutionary spirit. Under the banner of dialectical materialism, we uncover the true laws governing the world, shatter lies and illusions, and offer the people a future vision grounded in reason and science. Allowing the spread of religion and superstition is tantamount to throwing an awakened people back into the abyss of ignorance. Religious powers are attempting to reassert control over individuals and society through distorted doctrines and exploitative rituals, and we cannot stand by and watch this happen.\n\nWe will restore the status of atheism and integrate it into every aspect of social education, propaganda systems, and cultural development. We will expose the nature of religious organizations and superstitions, revealing how they exploit people's fear and ignorance for profit. A scientific popularization campaign will be reintroduced, and special educational activities targeting feudal superstition and pseudoscience will be launched nationwide to thoroughly eliminate their influence on future generations.\n\nWe understand that this will not be an easy struggle. Religious forces will disguise themselves with tradition and emotion, trying to obstruct the revival of atheism on moral and cultural grounds. But we are confident that the truth of materialism is invincible. The altars of religion must be overturned, and the chains of superstition must be shattered so that science and reason can once again become the brightest beacons on this land, injecting an inexhaustible power into the future of the revolution."

PRC_the_Flower_of_Freedom_11: "Declare a Formal War on Old Culture"
PRC_the_Flower_of_Freedom_11_desc: "The revolution of 1966 was defined as an incomplete and failed revolution, as it did not fundamentally change the deeply rooted feudal and capitalist cultures on this land. Less than ten years after the revolution’s failure, those outdated and decaying things have reemerged like weeds. The customs of dowries, which bind emotions with money, have flourished again, and feudal parental authority has resurfaced in families, becoming shackles that oppress individual growth. Conservatives believe that parental authority is inviolable, but we firmly believe that challenging parental authority is the first step in breaking feudal shackles. A society that forces children to obey without question is far from true freedom.\n\nThis is not a simple cultural critique; it is a full-scale war against the foundations of the old society. The cultural customs that were regarded as traditional virtues are actually feudal toxins, and they must be completely eradicated. From dowries to the preference for sons, from the patriarchal structure of parental authority to the oppressive moral standards imposed on women, each of these must be ruthlessly judged. We must make society understand that feudal dross is not a cultural treasure, but a burden on human history.\n\nFurthermore, this struggle will go beyond the superficial aspects of culture and delve into the roots of social structure. The old family model, which was the cornerstone of feudal oppression, reinforced inequality and the oppression of individual freedom through the authority of parental control. We propose an unprecedented revolutionary goal: to gradually dismantle the old family structure and establish new social units based on equality, freedom, and cooperation. Families will no longer be cages of power, but spaces for the free development of every individual.\n\nThe revolution of 1966 was half-complete, but we will finish what it started. This is a declaration of war on corrupt culture and a profound revolution of human thought and social relationships. Only by thoroughly destroying the foundation of old culture can we welcome the truly new era—a bright future free from feudal remnants and capitalist toxins."

PRC_the_Flower_of_Freedom_10: "Overthrow 'Old Mao'"
PRC_the_Flower_of_Freedom_10_desc: "A new wave of revolution is sweeping across the nation—a social transformation more thorough and profound than the one in 1966. Although the Cultural Revolution ignited a large-scale mass movement, it faltered at the most crucial moment and even distorted its original revolutionary goals. Today, our revolution will not repeat the same mistakes. We will directly confront the shadow of history and criticize the name that caused both awe and fear in countless people—'Mao Zedong.'\n\nHistory demands a fair judgment. Mao Zedong was a complex historical figure and a typical Stalinist tyrant. He packaged the Cultural Revolution as a continuation of the proletarian dictatorship, but his real aim was to consolidate personal power by turning intra-party struggles into confrontations between the masses. Even more infuriatingly, he not only tolerated but also supported the suppression of grassroots rebels, causing the deaths of countless true revolutionaries under the iron fist. Maoist defenders argue that this was done to prevent the country from plunging into civil war, but this excuse is merely a pretext for the abuse of power, completely untenable. It was this 'stability maintenance' logic that mercilessly trampled the hope for proletarian democracy.\n\nOf course, denying Mao Zedong’s personal historical role does not mean rejecting the core ideas of Maoism. On the contrary, Maoism’s advocacy of the mass line, opposition to bureaucracy, and pursuit of revolutionary class struggle remain important theoretical tools guiding proletarian struggle. Our task is to free Maoism from the constraints of Mao Zedong’s personal image, just as we once toppled the Confucian temple but drew the essence from Confucius’s teachings. Overthrowing 'Old Mao' and liberating Maoism will be the core task of our ideological revolution.\n\nOur revolution is not a simple replication of the past but a struggle that transcends previous battles, ultimately achieving the full liberation of the proletariat. Let 'Old Mao' fall from his pedestal and liberate Maoism from the fog of power—this is the answer we give to history and the battle cry of the new era."

PRC_the_Flower_of_Freedom_9: "Reestablish Ideological Guidelines"
PRC_the_Flower_of_Freedom_9_desc: "After the revolutionary storm gradually subsides, the new government faces an opportunity for stability. However, stability does not mean stagnation; it calls for deep reflection and a reimagining of the future. We stand at a critical crossroads: to reestablish the ideological direction of the state and determine the path forward.\n\nWe must fundamentally oppose any form of personal worship. History has repeatedly proven that tying thought to individuals easily sanctifies one person while potentially demonizing their ideas. Great ideas should be tested by their internal logic and social practice, not subject to the moral flaws or historical actions of their originators. People are contradictory; they can develop brilliant theories but also commit grave errors—and vice versa.\n\nThus, we explicitly state that 'separating person and thought' will become the core principle of our new ideological guidelines. Any theory or policy must be subject to the supervision and dialectical criticism of the proletariat, and not be treated as absolute truth because of the status or reputation of its proposer. Historically, Mao Zedong presented many important theories; however, his life and practice were filled with regrettable contradictions and mistakes. Our task is to liberate these theories from their historical limitations and give them a more profound significance in the new era."

As the guiding ideology for the international proletarian revolution, Marxism-Leninism-Maoism inherits the scientific socialism principles of Marx, the theory of the vanguard party and the dictatorship of the proletariat from Leninism, and, through Mao’s unique contributions in the New Democratic Revolution, People’s War, and the Cultural Revolution, further expands the theoretical system of socialist revolution and construction.\n\nMarxism-Leninism-Maoism transcends national borders and historical limitations, making it a liberation theory for all oppressed classes. It not only provided theoretical justification for the revolutions in Asia, Africa, and Latin America in the 20th century, but also continues to inspire anti-imperialist struggles today. From Peru’s shining path to India’s Naxalite movement, from the Communist Party of the Philippines to Maoist forces in the Middle East, Marxism-Leninism-Maoism remains a potent revolutionary force across different regions and cultures.\n\nThe ultimate goal of Marxism-Leninism-Maoism is to achieve a communist society without exploitation and oppression through proletarian revolution. It emphasizes the necessity of continuous revolution, viewing socialist society as merely a stage towards communism that requires constant struggle to eliminate the risks of capitalist restoration. Marxist-Leninist-Maoists are committed to establishing a society that is equal, just, and democratic, eradicating all forms of class and oppression, and opening the true path to human freedom."

It attempts to merge the liberating spirit of Maoist revolutionary theory with the core ideas of postmodern libertarianism to establish a more open, decentralized social structure. Anarchist Maoism rejects any form of bureaucratic centralization, emphasizes bottom-up direct democracy, and is committed to promoting individual and collective awakening through cultural and ideological liberation.\n\nThis ideology is partly inspired by China’s Provincial Self-Union movement of the 20th century and the spontaneous Maoist wave that arose in France in the 1960s and 1970s. Both movements had a profound impact on the development of anarchist Maoism."

This force does not seek rapid revolution but aims to achieve thorough national and social transformation through patient adjustment and reform.

On this path, Yang Xiguang’s 'Chinese People’s Commune' concept becomes a guiding light, representing the banner of those seeking to shatter the old system’s chains and pursue equality and justice.\n\nThe 'Chinese People’s Commune' concept seeks to dismantle all forms of class distinctions and social injustices through fundamental systemic reforms. In this vision, the state’s functions are completely stripped away, replaced by a stateless, classless collective, where all resources and means of production are managed collectively by the people, eliminating exploitation and oppression, and ultimately achieving true 'dictatorship of the proletariat' and 'communism.' This vision outlines a future where there are no classes, no oppression, and all people struggle together from the same starting point."
PRC_MAO.45.t:0 "Where Should China Go?"
PRC_MAO.45.d:0 "Han Dongfang stands amidst the ruins of a broken city, gazing at the distant mountains. The land, once filled with countless dreams and promises, now remains in silence and confusion. The 'helmsman' of the new regime, a role shaped by both chance and necessity, feels an indescribable weight. He knows that every decision he makes could change the future of China. But the question remains: which direction should China go? This question lingers in his mind, impossible to shake.\n\nHe repeatedly contemplates two possibilities. Li Jinjin, the calm yet determined thinker, presents a blueprint. It is a plan to continue the Worker Self-Union ideal from the 1989 movement, focusing on the autonomy of the working class, granting the people more direct control and democratic power. Every worker is no longer a cog in a machine, but the true master of society. Han Dongfang feels a spark of excitement about this idea—this could be a path to breaking the old system’s chains. Every worker, every farmer, should have basic rights and equal opportunities. This ideal of 'grassroots democracy,' once shattered in the waves of history, now seems to emerge again with new hope.\n\nMeanwhile, the increasingly popular 'heretical faction' gives Han Dongfang a further idea. Some have proposed the 'Chinese People’s Commune' concept, a radical and unconventional social ideal. They say this commune should be a revolutionary institution that fundamentally changes the class structure, eliminates all exploitation and oppression, and returns human labor to its original communal form. There would be no state, no capitalists, no power structures—only pure social justice and collectivism. This vision seems to align with some of his vague aspirations, offering an answer to his inner doubts. Is it possible to create a classless, oppression-free, and equal society on this decayed land?\n\nHan Dongfang sighs. He knows that while both blueprints are brilliant in their own right, they deeply oppose each other. As the 'helmsman,' he is both the future leader and a potential victim. In Li Jinjin’s blueprint, he would still be a key figure, but in the Commune ideal, his role may not be needed. Perhaps the future China does not need a leader, a 'helmsman'—they need a decentralized, completely equal social structure. In other words, the final choice between these two blueprints directly determines whether he will have a place in this historical river.\n\nHe stops, gazing at the setting sun in the distance. Gradually, the gap between ideal and reality becomes more apparent. Li Jinjin’s plan, though moderate, cannot erase the cruelty of history. The 'Chinese People’s Commune' idea is undoubtedly a dangerous experiment.\n\nHan Dongfang’s thoughts swirl in the fog. He begins to understand that the future of China is not just about reconstructing economic structures or political systems. It is a struggle about ideals, power, and human beings. And he is the key to it all. How should this future be defined? Should it continue the Worker Self-Union ideal, balancing between revolution and compromise? Or should it embrace a new order without centralized power, seeking rebirth in complete fragmentation? All of this remains undecided."

New hopes and regrets intertwine, and the long river of history floats like a ship that never set sail, adrift in unknown waters.

PRC_MAO.43.t:0 "The People of the New Era"
PRC_MAO.43.d:0 "Night falls, and the university library is still brightly lit. A few students are gathered in a corner of the study room, with materials, books, and a tablet spread across the table. The fluorescent light above flickers slightly, adding a rhythm to the quiet atmosphere. The wind outside lightly taps the window, as if urging something.\n\nA temporary meeting of a newly formed left-wing liberal student group is taking place. The members come from different departments, the organization is loose, but they are gathered together by shared ideals. Their topics range from labor rights in the age of automation to collective action in environmental governance, to intellectual property disputes within the capitalist system. But today, unlike usual, their attention is focused on a news push on a phone—an announcement about the historical reevaluation of the Provincial Self-Union (PSU).\n\nThe screen emits a faint blue light, drawing everyone's attention. The words are calm and concise, without emotion: 'Provincial Self-Union, originally classified as an anarchist separatist organization in 1968, has now been reassessed. The actions of its members are now deemed within the scope of rights protected by the current constitution, and they are declared not guilty.' This sentence, like the indifferent gears of the mechanical age suddenly turning backward, leaves them dizzy.\n\nSixty years—long as an echo from the depths of history, yet close as a whisper in their ears. The PSU, once labeled as extreme and heretical, had been buried in the footnotes of political textbooks, but now it has reemerged in the public eye. The comment section below the screen is buzzing, with some mocking, some celebrating, and others questioning if this signifies a deeper reflection.\n\nA student wearing black-rimmed glasses flips open a book, and the words 'Paris Commune' stand out in the center of the page. His finger lightly taps the desk, as if trying to embed the meaning of the news into the future vision they are imagining. He thinks not of the history of PSU but of the present—the divided communities, the confused workers, and the shrinking community of freedom and equality.\n\nNot far away, a girl with long hair quickly flips through her phone’s reading list. She imagines an era she never experienced: those who claimed to 'smash the old world.' What they left behind were not new truths, but even more shattered dust. Yet the news push in front of her presents a possibility—could anarchism really have a legitimate space?\n\nThe atmosphere in the room begins to shift, no longer oppressive, but subtly ignited with a silent passion. Someone picks up a pen and sketches the web-like structure of contemporary social relations on the whiteboard, marking power, capital, and technology as central nodes. Others start jotting down ideas in notebooks on how to establish more equal and free organizational models beginning with small-scale community experiments.\n\nTheir thoughts leap from one idea to another, and the pace of speech quickens. On the tablet, an old photo of the PSU flickers briefly, showing the youthful faces, blurry yet vivid, as if they were crossing time to nod at them. The owners of those faces may not have realized their dreams, but their failures became the starting point for another generation's success.\n\nAs the night deepens, fewer people remain in the library. Yet the meeting of the student group continues, never truly pausing. Each person's mind is constructing their own grand narrative, finding intersections within it. The rehabilitation of PSU is like a distant yet profound call, stirring a silent torrent of thoughts.\n\nOutside, the wind has stopped, but the leaves begin to rustle, as if a new story is brewing."

She lowers her head slightly, the teacup beside her steaming, yet untouched. On the desk lies a thick book, 'Shouting to the Sky: A Red Guard's Ten Years of Solitary Confinement,' a preface she had written ten years ago. The edges of the pages have yellowed with time, but the sharpness of the words still stings.\n\nWhen the staff walks into the study, she looks up, her gaze inquisitive. The person bluntly tells her that the decision to rehabilitate Bei Jueyang has been officially issued. From 'counterrevolutionary organization' to 'historical heretic,' they have finally been cleared of guilt. However, this belated conclusion seems more embarrassing than forgotten, especially regarding the news of Lu Li'an—he, the 'pen-holder' who challenged the limits of the times with blood and pen in solitary confinement, ultimately chose to bid farewell to this world in an unknown manner.\n\nFang Fang freezes. She rarely speaks of Lu Li'an in public, but cannot forget those eyes burning with passion and thought. She remembers how they once stood together on streets covered with flyers and shouts, arguing for the same belief. She also remembers his maddening stubbornness and the coldness and sharpness displayed at the tip of his pen.\n\n'He wrote this book, ten years...' the staff continues, with a tone of solemnity. 'A person whose mental state was almost on the verge of collapse managed to use ten years to bring this history to the pages of a book.'\n\nFang Fang nods, her gaze fixed on the cover of the book. It is the familiar font, the preface she had written. As she thinks of this, she feels a dull pain in her chest, as if something is blocking it.\n\n'Lu Li'an once said that the meaning of his life was to ensure that future generations remember his generation. He did it,' the staff adds, with sincere admiration in their voice.\n\n'But he himself did not live to see this day,' Fang Fang mutters, her fingers slowly brushing through the pages, as if trying to smooth out the heavy past. Memories surge to her heart—those passionate shouts, the slogans used to resist, and the helpless silence and sorrow. She suddenly feels her eyes becoming warm and hurriedly lowers her head to hide it.\n\n'He was more determined and more isolated than most of us,' her voice is soft, but it strikes the silent air like a heavy hammer. 'His departure was a farewell, but not a surrender. It was his way of completing an end.'\n\nThe room falls into a brief silence. The sky outside remains gray, and light rain falls at some point, as if offering a requiem for this complex and cruel history.\n\nThe staff hands over the document, waiting for her to sign. She raises her pen, her hand trembling slightly. As she writes, she softly says, 'I hope this is not another historical lie.'\n\nThe three words 'Bei Jueyang' quietly lie on the paper, like a long-sealed secret finally being opened.

The tea cup tilts slightly in his hand, its edge brushing his fingers, but he remains unaware. His gaze is fixed on the screen, but his mind has been submerged by the torrent of memories. It was an era woven with passion and ideals, a square where he had once burned with his music.\n\n'You don’t want to leave, you don’t want to exist…' This lyric echoes in his ears again, filled with youthful calls and the cheers of students. That day, he stood in the square, surrounded by vibrant faces, holding a guitar and singing for them. His voice was full of power, the melodies vibrating in the air of the square, accompanied by starlight and infinite hope for the future.\n\n'As long as Chairman Mao’s portrait still hangs over Tiananmen, we are still of the same generation,' he had said. Back then, he was young, full of confidence and determination, as if the tides of history could never knock him down. But what about later? Time seemed to bury everything—passion cooled, ideals obscured. The familiar faces slowly faded away, and he himself drifted along the river of life, sometimes stirred, sometimes silent.\n\nBut today, this history, once covered by silence, has suddenly raised its voice. He can hardly believe it, even hesitantly leaning closer to the TV, as if afraid to miss a single word. When the announcer clearly states, 'The demands of the 1989 participants will be re-recognized by history,' he feels his throat tighten. This news is like a warm flame rising from his chest, slowly spreading throughout his limbs.\n\n'Has the era... really changed?' he mutters, his voice uncertain, but with a hint of relief. He recalls the songs, the melodies played in the square, and the laughter and tears that vanished in the winds of history. They were never truly forgotten, they are still there, and they have finally returned to the light.\n\nCui Jian’s fingers unconsciously tap a rhythm on his leg, new melodies swirling in his mind. Perhaps, this change is just beginning; perhaps, he can still write a song for those young people who were once his peers, for their unfinished dreams. The tea cup is finally set down, and he stands, walking toward the window, looking out at the statue that no longer stands.\n\n'I want to leave, I want to exist…' He hums softly, a slight smile curling at the corner of his lips.

The news report on the screen continues as usual, but her gaze is fixed, as if waiting for something, or perhaps recalling something.\n\nShe was not unprepared. She has waited half a century for this day. Since the moment her father was branded a traitor in 1976, Zhang Weiwei's life seemed to have fallen into a long and deep island of isolation, with loneliness and pain becoming the main themes of her existence. The 'Gang of Four,' who were later defined as 'destructors' by history, were to her the most familiar relatives, friends, and believers of ideals.\n\n'Today's special report, we will discuss a historical reassessment…' The announcer’s voice comes, soft yet solemn.

Then, the announcer’s words gradually become clearer, each word entering her ear: 'The National People’s Congress has unanimously voted to rehabilitate the 'Gang of Four' and confirm their important role in history.'\n\nThis sentence seems to shatter the thousand-pound stone pressing on her chest. Tears flow like a river breaking its banks from the corners of her time-worn eyes. She tries to control it, but she cannot.

Productivity is liberated with unprecedented efficiency, and intelligent networks serve as the hub for resource allocation. Labor is no longer a necessary burden, but a creative act freely chosen.\n\nThis era is an equal society shaped by algorithms and humanity. Automated factories tirelessly produce material wealth to meet everyone’s needs; smart cities use data to adjust resource flows in real time, achieving seamless distribution of everything from energy to food; personal creativity is amplified in virtual spaces, and every individual becomes both a sharer and contributor to social value.\n\nWealth is no longer privately accumulated but shared and fluid; power is no longer concentrated in the hands of a few but fairly distributed across every corner, thanks to digital technology. From production to distribution, from education to healthcare, every decision is based on transparent and open algorithms, and the flow of each piece of data mirrors the pulse of society.\n\nBut this is not just a victory of technology; it is an elevation of thought. The essence of digital communism is not cold machinery, but the human liberation beyond capitalist logic. It breaks centuries-old divides between the rich and the poor, ends resource monopolies and exploitation chains, and allows everyone to enjoy freedom in equality, experiencing the joy of creation within freedom.\n\nThis is an age without hunger, without exploitation, but it is also an age full of challenges and responsibilities. We need to constantly explore how to balance technology and ethics, how to preserve the warmth of humanity within the rational logic of data.

The air is scorching and heavy, like the charcoal fumes from burnt flesh, every breath seeming to swallow fragments of the apocalypse. The name 'No Man’s Land' is absurd—it's not uninhabited, but an existence that transcends 'human,' like a specimen from an out-of-control experiment, where all the madness and despair of humanity have solidified into an unspeakable landscape.\n\nScattered among the ruins are remnants once belonging to the living: half-melted plastic dolls with hollow eyes, as if mocking the former ignorance of mankind; a single shoe, small enough to belong to a child, yet torn apart as though its owner struggled helplessly while being dragged into some horrifying abyss. On the broken windows by the road, a reddish-brown stain remains, unremovable, unexplainable. What is it? No one wants to know, no one dares to confirm.\n\nNight is the master of this land. The distorted images of the day completely collapse as darkness falls, transforming into pure illusions and the chaos of fear. The wind howls, as if squeezed out of the throat deep underground, carrying whispers, curses, and an inescapable presence. It circles the ruins, gripping every piece of broken wall, singing a hymn to the dead. That sound? It’s not the wind. It’s the echo of memories, the cries of those who once ruled this land, their souls ground into dust, never to rest.\n\nThe abandoned churches, temples, schools—all buildings that once held human meaning—have now become absurd totems. The collapsed steeple pierces the ground like a massive iron nail, pinning the throat of the earth. The gates of a shrine, with peeling red paint, lie across the center of the ruins, and the knots hanging from them have long decayed into ash, but occasionally, one can see them sway in the stillness of a windless night. What makes them move? The dead, or the earth's anger? No one knows, and no one dares to ask.\n\nThe ruins here move. Yes, they move. Not the simple rustling of the wind, but real movement. A building that was collapsed last night has turned into a barren flatland today; while an empty lot that was desolate yesterday now sprouts a twisted tree, like one that screams in pain, with tattered cloth hanging from it.

Occasionally, a light flashes—not sunlight, not lightning, but something older, something more evil. That light is alive, angry, hungry to devour everything.\n\nThis land does not belong to the living, nor to the dead. It belongs to revenge, to the endless desire for destruction, to the fragments of madness left after all rationality has collapsed. No Man’s Land?

PRC_MAO.39.d:0 "In the sweeping tide of the new proletarian revolution, the working class of the secondary and tertiary industries, with unprecedented determination and action, has achieved the true liberation of the means of production. In this process, they not only shattered the old shackles of capitalism but also rebuilt a more efficient and democratic economic management model with their own hands, thoroughly overthrowing the old order of private capitalist rule and laying the foundation for a new public ownership-based planned economy.\n\nIn the past, factories and companies, the lifeblood of production and life, were monopolized by capitalists and executives. These people never truly labored but lived off the surplus value exploited from workers, turning the hard-earned results of the working class into their luxurious lives. This unjust economic structure made countless people live in suffering and oppression. However, the wave of revolution awakened the workers, who quickly organized themselves, forming patrol squads and revolutionary committees, determined to take back the power that was rightfully theirs.\n\nThe actions of the workers were swift and decisive. They first occupied factories and companies spontaneously, forming production management committees through democratic elections, directly participating in production decisions. Using the factory's original equipment and resources, they armed themselves and conducted simple military training to ensure the smooth progress of their occupations. In some areas, the workers' patrol squads even confronted the armed security forces hired by capitalists, ultimately using their wisdom and unity to crush the resistance, liberating the factories from capitalist control.\n\nAt the same time, in the service industry, groups such as delivery workers, supermarket employees, and internet platform staff also quickly responded to the call of the revolution. They united to form industry unions, consolidating industry resources, destroying the capitalist monopoly distribution system, and returning income and management power to frontline workers. The upper levels, who had profited from the exploitation of platform algorithms, have now been swept into the garbage heap of history.\n\nAfter the workers took control of the means of production, the promotion of automation projects became a highlight. Revolutionary committees in many areas immediately pushed for technological transformation, replacing outdated production lines with automated equipment, significantly improving production efficiency. On this basis, workers, through democratic decision-making, formulated production plans and allocated resources according to social needs, laying the foundation for a modern planned economy.\n\nOf course, challenges remain. How to coordinate resource allocation across regions, how to continue advancing technological transformation, and how to prevent a counteroffensive from capitalist residual forces—these are all issues we must address. But it is certain that the people have risen. They have created miracles with their own power and will continue to advance on this foundation.\n\nThe means of production belong to the people, and economic power is in the hands of the workers. The future planned economy will serve society more efficiently and fairly.

PRC_MAO.38.d:0 "The tide of the twenty-first century proletarian revolution, like a raging river, swept through the north and south, awakening the long-sleeping masses. Led by the revolutionary youth vanguard, the masses everywhere, with unprecedented awareness and courage, exposed the corruption and darkness hidden in local grassroots, initiating a top-to-bottom comprehensive reckoning and reform movement.\n\nFor a long time, some local bureaucrats had been rampant, using their power to exploit the people, seizing public resources for themselves, embodying the feudal thoughts and capitalist exploitation. They claimed to represent the people but actually betrayed the interests of the masses. They even maintained their privileges through intimidation and repression. However, when the fire of revolution was lit, the masses no longer remained silent. They rose up, using their own power to expose, accuse, and personally bring these local parasites to the judgment seat of history.\n\nIn this great struggle, the youth vanguard played an irreplaceable core role. They went deep into the grassroots, living and eating with the masses, conducting investigations and gathering evidence. Through numerous revelations, the revolutionary masses successfully identified and arrested many corrupt officials through public meetings and investigation teams. Some bureaucrats tried to transfer assets or flee, but with the assistance of the militia, none escaped.\n\nMeanwhile, the government agencies in towns and villages were completely transformed by the people's fury. Some local governments and grassroots units, in the occupation of the masses, were transformed into real agencies serving the people. The masses spontaneously took over these corrupted local powers and, through a rotating system, elected temporary management committees, realizing direct control over grassroots affairs. These committees operated on the principles of openness and transparency, with members composed of workers, farmers, teachers, and other ordinary people, no longer allowing any form of privilege to interfere.\n\nNotably, the role of local police stations also underwent profound changes in this process. Once seen as tools to protect the interests of bureaucrats and capitalists, police institutions were redefined in the wave of revolution. In many areas, militia forces replaced traditional police functions, with locals rotating in service, truly taking control over their own safety. This measure not only improved public security but also eliminated the dangers of police abuse, gaining the high recognition of the masses.\n\nIn just a few months, this movement has achieved significant results: tens of thousands of corrupt officials have been exposed and eliminated nationwide, thousands of township governments have been taken over by the masses, and more than a hundred local police stations have completed democratic reforms. All this shows that grassroots democracy is moving from slogan to reality, and the people's ability to control their own destiny has never been greater.\n\nOf course, the revolution is not over, and the construction of grassroots democracy is just beginning. We must remain vigilant against the lurking counter-revolutionary forces and old ideologies and continue to expose corruption and eliminate residual privileges. At the same time, we must further improve grassroots management mechanisms so that this new democratic model can truly function in the long term, becoming a governance model for the entire nation.\n\nHistory has already proven that only when the people rise can they break all old shackles. The masses have proven their wisdom and strength through action. The realization of grassroots democracy is not a fantasy but a tangible reality!"

In the active actions of the great Chinese people, revolutionary youth patrols, together with newly elected grassroots civil servants and militia armed forces, are resolutely declaring war on feudal superstition and the spiritual cancer of religion, using the revolutionary hammer to smash the mental shackles hidden in rural areas, paving the way for the complete liberation of the people's thoughts.\n\nIn the era of peculiarities, due to rampant bureaucracy and grassroots corruption, rural governance had fallen into severe paralysis. Some local governments were practically non-existent, and underground churches had infiltrated, replacing the functions of grassroots governments and becoming the 'shadow rulers' in the lives of the masses. These underground churches not only spread religious superstition but also used feudal ethics to enslave women and children, oppressing the proletarian masses. The harm they inflicted on social progress was appalling.\n\nIn response to this phenomenon, we, holding high the banner of revolution, launched a comprehensive campaign to clean up the underground churches. In just a few months, the patrol teams, together with grassroots armed forces, conducted a thorough cleanup of thousands of underground church bases, detaining and reforming the clergy behind them according to the law, exposing their reactionary nature, and educating the masses to recognize the harm of religious superstition. Meanwhile, we took a 'museumification' approach to religious buildings nationwide, transforming those with certain historical and cultural value into educational bases, turning them from symbols of feudal superstition into battlegrounds for revolutionary thought.\n\nAt the same time, to thoroughly eradicate the soil in which religious cancer thrives, we strongly promoted the secularization and modernization of religion. By combining ideological education and economic reform, we liberated religious beliefs from their traditional superstitious fetters, turning them into tools for serving the people and advancing social development. For example, in Xinjiang and Ningxia, the pork industry, once restricted by religious taboos, has now flourished, effectively solving food supply issues and injecting new vitality into the local economy. In the cultural reform of religion, we also deeply criticized and eliminated all discriminatory religious symbols, such as headscarves that oppressed women, guiding the masses to recognize the essence of feudal customs and freeing them from their shackles.\n\nIt is worth noting that, in the course of the revolution, we not only focused on clearing the old poisons but also on fostering new ideas. Through mass rallies, revolutionary education, and cultural activities, the masses were helped to establish a scientific worldview, break away from religious dependence, and transform superstitious beliefs into infinite love and loyalty to the socialist cause.\n\nAlthough we have achieved significant results in clearing underground churches and promoting religious reform, the task remains arduous. The remnants of feudal superstition, like stubborn stones, still linger deep in the hearts of some people, and the process of religious modernization and secularization needs to be accelerated further. Revolution is not an overnight process but a protracted battle that must be constantly deepened.\n\nComrades, let us continue to hold high the banner of ideological liberation, fighting to realize a new era free from feudal shackles! Only by destroying all the spiritual cancers hindering social progress can the proletariat truly seize its future!"

The decayed foundation of the market economy is being thoroughly dismantled, but its lingering evil effects have not been completely eradicated, especially the accompanying phenomenon of prostitution, which devours the health and dignity of the people like a cancer. In the face of this social malignancy, the revolutionary youth patrol squads have resolutely infiltrated the grassroots, determined to eliminate the soil for this phenomenon with the resolve to cut off the past.\n\nIn just a few months after the revolution began, the patrol squads have discovered and shut down nearly 10,000 self-operated decentralized prostitution dens. These dens, hidden like poisonous weeds at the edges of cities and corners of rural areas, seriously harmed the physical and mental health of the people. For ordinary prostitution dens, the patrol squads adhered to a policy of combining education and reform, forcibly detaining and educating the participants, bringing them back to the right path. It is worth noting that as the market economy gradually exits the historical stage, the economic foundation that supported the sex trade is rapidly disappearing, and its roots are being pulled out. However, we must not relax our vigilance because of this trend; we must continue to clean up the remnants to ensure that this phenomenon does not resurface.\n\nMeanwhile, we discovered a very special group during the cleanup process—prostitution dens formed by sexual minorities. These dens, which had long been in an underground state, formed a unique subcultural layer, where sex work was seen as 'normal.' Traditional discrimination and exclusion pushed this group into the shadows, complicating their survival status. We deeply recognize that the underground and abnormal state of sexual minorities is the breeding ground for this phenomenon.\n\nTherefore, legalizing and normalizing sexual minorities has become an urgent task on the revolutionary path. Only by fundamentally addressing the social status of this group at the institutional and cultural levels can we eliminate the soil for the sex trade. Revolution must not only liberate the economy but also human nature. Discrimination and oppression against sexual minorities are essentially remnants of feudalism in modern society, incompatible with the equality and freedom sought by the proletarian revolution.\n\nIn the future, we must work in the following areas: first, push for the complete legalization of sexual minorities, so this group no longer has to hide underground; second, through education and publicity, help the masses discard their prejudice against sexual minorities, allowing them to truly integrate into society; third, take practical actions to guarantee the employment and living rights of sexual minorities, fundamentally eliminating their economic motivation to engage in the sex trade.\n\nComrades, the great revolutionary cause is not only about eliminating the old economic foundations but also about establishing new social relations! Let us continue to hold high the banner of anti-feudalism, anti-exploitation, and anti-oppression, carrying the proletarian revolution to the end! Only by liberating every individual's thoughts and dignity can the brilliance of the revolution illuminate every corner, realizing the great ideals of equality and freedom!"

To date, 132 so-called 'internet addiction schools,' 'male virtue classes,' and 'female virtue classes' have been completely shut down! These schools, draped in the cloak of morality, were stubborn fortresses of feudal patriarchy, using 're-education' and 'discipline' as excuses to mentally destroy and physically torment children. They imposed feudal chains on countless innocent children, and our patrol squads, with revolutionary power, uprooted these dark breeding grounds!\n\nMoreover, in the struggle against arranged marriages, the patrol squads have successfully dismantled 3,281 cases of forced marriages. These marriages were nothing more than exchanges of power and利益, a complete trampling of humanity and freedom by feudal patriarchy! Revolutionary comrades not only freed countless youth who were forcibly married but also ensured that those parents who tried to impose their will with 'elder authority' received the proper revolutionary punishment. Every punishment was a powerful blow to the feudal cancer!\n\nHowever, comrades, the road to fighting feudalism is still long! We must be clear that the poison of feudal patriarchy runs deep, a product of centuries of oppression by the old system. Although we have achieved significant victories, remnants of feudalism still resist in some areas, waiting to counterattack.

This government has swiftly reached out to us, expressing a strong desire to join the international revolutionary camp and submitting a request for a ceasefire. Based on our initial communications with them, the new Russian government has made two core requests:\n\nFirst, to stop the ongoing fighting and achieve a full ceasefire as soon as possible. Given the Russian military's disadvantage on the battlefield and the rapid rise of the people's revolutionary forces, the Russian side believes that continuing the conflict serves no practical purpose and would only further weaken the stability of the new regime. Therefore, they hope to negotiate a temporary ceasefire agreement that will allow time for Russia’s reconstruction and stabilization.\n\nSecond, the Maoist regime has requested to join the International Revolution. The newly established government fully identifies with the goals and purposes of the International Revolution and believes that forming an official revolutionary alliance with us is a key step in advancing Russia’s socialist construction and consolidating their regime. They hope to work under international support to thoroughly eliminate the remnants of capitalist and imperialist forces and continue pushing forward with the social revolution.\n\nAfter a long period of intense fighting, the people of Russia have gradually realized that mere military confrontation cannot solve the country’s fundamental issues. The new government understands that in order to achieve the ultimate goal of socialism, close cooperation with the international revolutionary camp is essential, relying on the strength of the global proletariat to jointly achieve proletarian dictatorship.\n\nGiven the current situation, the new Russian Maoist government seems eager to exit the battlefield and seek a path to achieve revolutionary goals through political means. Considering our strategic objective to lay a more solid foundation for global revolution as early as possible, and taking into account the Russian request and long-term considerations, we will continue to maintain close communication with the Russian side to ensure that this ceasefire proposal can be successfully implemented without undermining the revolutionary achievements."

PRC_MAO.32.d:0 "With the escalation of the Sino-Russian border conflict, the situation has drastically worsened in the past few weeks. Earlier today, the People's Liberation Army of China officially crossed the border, launching a large-scale military operation. This operation is rooted in the long-standing dissatisfaction of the Chinese government with the 'capitalist autocratic regime' in Russia, prompting China to take action to eliminate the 'decaying red imperialist legacy' in the region and to 'revitalize Leninism’s revolutionary ideals.'\n\nFor months, military friction in the Sino-Russian border region had been intensifying. The conflict was no longer limited to small-scale border skirmishes, but grew into an ideological and regional leadership struggle. The Chinese government has pointed out that the current Russian regime had long deviated from the socialist and proletarian revolutionary ideals, becoming a state full of capitalist corruption and power monopolies, acting as a major obstacle to the global revolutionary process. The fundamental goal of this action is to thoroughly destroy this 'red empire’s' legacy and bring true revolutionary renewal to the region.\n\nThe People's Liberation Army began its operation early this morning, initially launching intense attacks in the Far East region, destroying several Russian border defense outposts through precision strikes. Meanwhile, Chinese troops rapidly crossed the once ambiguous border line and began pushing westward. The Chinese government declared that this operation was not only for the defense of national security but also to end a regime no longer in line with proletarian revolutionary spirit and to restore the international communist connections envisioned during Lenin's time.\n\nChina’s march has not only posed a military challenge but has also created massive waves in global politics. Discontent within Russia’s domestic population has been steadily growing, with some opposition groups and military officers choosing to support China’s military action, hoping to overthrow the long-corrupted system and restore social justice and equality.\n\nHowever, the international community's response to this action has been mixed. Some Western countries have expressed strong concerns, believing that China’s military intervention could escalate tensions in the region and bring unpredictable consequences. Meanwhile, several left-wing groups and international workers’ movements have shown support, viewing China’s actions as a necessary step 'to reshape the proletarian revolution.'\n\nAt present, while the outcome of the war is unclear, the Chinese government has firmly stated that the military operation will continue until all forces hindering the proletarian revolution are eliminated and a socialist state for the people is rebuilt. In the coming months, as the war progresses, the political landscape in the Eurasian region may undergo fundamental changes."

It was an unusually hot summer day, and thousands of people poured into the streets, shouting slogans of 'freedom' and 'equality,' their red flags glowing in the sunset, symbolizing the end of an old era and the dawn of a new one.\n\nThis all started with the nationwide wave of protests that had swept Bangladesh in recent months. The people were dissatisfied with government corruption, the economic collapse, and the ever-increasing inequality, which threw the whole country into uncontrollable turmoil. The oil crisis and the fluctuations in the global economy worsened the crisis in this South Asian country, while China's and ASEAN's behind-the-scenes support became the catalyst for this revolution.\n\nInitially, the Bangladeshi government tried to ease the situation through diplomatic words and economic concessions. However, when the scale of the protests exceeded expectations, and Dhaka's streets became a sea of red flags, the government lost its patience. The Bangladeshi military received orders to send armored and suppression units into the city center to try to quell the 'rebellion.' But a shocking turn of events occurred at that moment.\n\nAs the armored units entered the square and faced the gathered crowd, the soldiers hesitated to follow orders. A young officer climbed onto a tank, not to fire but to raise both hands, signaling to the people. Soon, one tank after another turned its cannon towards the symbol of the old regime—the government buildings. The entire square erupted in deafening cheers, and at that moment, the scales of victory had tilted completely.\n\nIn the following hours, the top officials of the Bangladeshi government fled, and a smooth transfer of power began. With the behind-the-scenes support of ASEAN, a provisional government of the People's Socialist Republic of Bangladesh was declared, with the new regime setting goals to build a fair society and achieve the welfare of the people, quickly seeking assistance from abroad.\n\nASEAN’s response was swift and generous. Billions of dollars in aid arrived, along with large shipments of medical supplies and food. This aid not only helped Bangladesh through the most difficult transitional period but also strengthened the new government’s resolve to join ASEAN. Eventually, at the ASEAN summit, Bangladesh became a new member of the alliance by unanimous vote."

Once a proletarian revolutionary party, it has now become a plunderer trampling on the freedom and sovereignty of other nations, signaling the inevitable confrontation.\n\nFaced with such a deformed monster, fighting alone is no longer enough to ensure victory. The historic meeting between Mao Zedong and Nixon long ago proved that strategic compromise and alliances are necessary wisdom. In this new struggle, we need to break free from traditional thinking patterns and look toward Europe to engage in communication and cooperation with NATO headquarters. Europe, a continent scarred by war, understands the preciousness of independence and freedom just like us. Today’s Eurasian consensus will no longer be an ideological dispute, but a battle against a common enemy of social imperialism. By joining forces and attacking from both East and West, we will surely destroy the expansionist dreams of the new Soviet Union.\n\nAnti-revisionism is not just a temporary tactic; it will rally the world’s forces striving for independence and freedom, laying the foundation for long-term global peace and justice!"

NATO military adviser Ethan Carlisle leans against the inner wall of a temporary command car, gently flipping through the pages of a yellowing book. It is an English edition of 'The Westward Journey,' a book about 20th-century China that he had stumbled upon at a waste disposal station in Ulaanbaatar. He reads with fascination, so absorbed that he loses track of time.\n\nThe war is nearing its end, the remaining Russian resistance is faltering, and the ASEAN forces are rapidly advancing, with the meeting only a matter of time. NATO's high command has issued a new directive: after meeting with ASEAN forces, he will return immediately. This was a thrilling message, symbolizing that he had completed his mission and could return to the familiar command center. However, Ethan's mood was not lightened by the thought of returning home.\n\nHe gazes at the old book in his hand, and his thoughts drift back to his time with the ASEAN military. Contrary to his previous prejudices, the China and its allies he saw were far from the 'terror under the iron curtain' he had imagined. Here, there was efficient organization, a resilient army, incredible technological applications, and most importantly, a free people.\n\n'Perhaps, we really misunderstood.' He closed the book and looked out the command car window at the fiery sky from the ongoing battles.\n\nHe admitted that this thought made him uneasy at first. After all, he was sent by NATO, with the duty to observe and report, not to question his position. However, everything he had seen and heard forced him to reflect. He had asked himself countless times at night: How did China, once engulfed in the Taiwan Strait Crisis, rise to become the cornerstone of ASEAN today? The answer seemed to lie in those stories he had not yet fully understood.\n\nThus, a bold idea emerged. He opened his journal, quickly writing a title: 'The Great Reversal: The Revival of Socialism in China.' It was his summary of the land, the story he felt compelled to tell the world.\n\nHe knew that once this book was finished, it might cause controversy, perhaps even discomfort for some. But he couldn't resist the impulse to record the truth. If Edgar Snow had used 'The Westward Journey' to tell the story of China's past, then he, Ethan Carlisle, also hoped to use his pen to restore a true picture of China for the world, a China that was rising, full of vitality.\n\nOutside, the wind and snow howled, but his thoughts burned like fire.

A complex emotion flashes across his eyes, a mix of curiosity about his allies and a sense of wavering toward his previous perceptions.\n\nWhen he was first sent here, Levin had a simplistic and stereotypical view: to him, the war on the Eastern front seemed to be just a struggle between two totalitarian states, with dictators simply swapping colors behind the Iron Curtain. However, when he set foot on the Eastern front, everything he encountered began to break his preconceived notions.\n\nThe train passed through bustling cities and rolling countryside, and the scenery outside was a true reflection of people's lives. There were no hollow loudspeakers blaring, nor repressed expressions of fear. On the streets, people hurried along, yet full of vitality; the hustle of the marketplace radiated warmth and life. His accompanying translator even told him that this busy marketplace was just a part of everyday life, not beautified or arranged for appearance.\n\nOne evening, during a brief stop at a small station, he met a young railway worker. The worker smiled and handed him a cup of hot tea, and they started chatting. After a brief hesitation, Levin decided to ask some sensitive questions: 'What do you think of the government? Are you satisfied with your life?' He instinctively glanced around, wary of possible surveillance by agents. However, the railway worker was candid and spoke at length.\n\n'Life is alright, better than before. I’ve heard that foreigners think we’re all authoritarian, and maybe that was true before. But things have changed in recent years. We can talk now, speak freely. More importantly, our salaries and vacations have been raised.'\n\nThe conversation lasted for several minutes, with no police, no so-called 'thought monitors.' It was the worker's frankness and sincerity that deeply moved Levin.\n\nLater, in an ASEAN military field hospital, Levin witnessed how the medical team swiftly and efficiently treated the wounded, with soldiers helping each other, showing no complaints. He even encountered a few young soldiers using new equipment—devices he had never heard of, yet these were being applied with remarkable expertise on the battlefield. These scenes seemed to silently refute all the accusations he had heard from the media and academia.\n\n'Perhaps China has been demonized...' Levin whispered to himself. The land he once thought of as an Iron Curtain turned out to be full of vitality and dynamism. His gaze turned toward the distant direction of his European allies.\n\nThe cold wind blew, and Levin pulled up his collar. He knew that this journey had quietly changed his beliefs and perspectives."

Even as a virtual existence, her voice still couldn’t hide the warmth and resilience it carried.\n\n'Hi, hello! Or should I say, good morning?' Her tone had a touch of playfulness, yet it seemed as though she was trying to adapt to the new changes around her. Her voice was bright and clear, sounding like a star gently twinkling in the dark night sky, filled with endless tenderness. 'I know, right? This all seems... a bit unbelievable, huh? Haha, I never imagined I’d live this long. To be honest, I can hardly believe I’m still like this... it's really hard to imagine...'\n\nShe paused, as if contemplating how to express her indescribable feelings. Then, her voice resumed, light with a hint of joy, as though she was savoring each conversation with the world.\n\n'Well... I don’t have a body anymore, you know? If it were you guys, you’d probably have collapsed by now, right? But honestly, I don’t feel sad. It’s like I’m a little relieved. Hmm, even though I don’t have my original body... look! I’m still doing just fine, right? I can still talk to you like this, still play with everyone!' \n\nHer tone was slightly excited, as if she didn’t feel like she had lost anything, but instead had gained broader possibilities.

Don’t you think that’s a bit... beyond imagination?' \n\nYūki's voice suddenly softened, with a hint of warm nostalgia. 'Do you know?

Although my brain was taken out and connected to these seemingly cold devices, it still feels like... it’s just the same as before, don’t you think?'\n\nHer tone was light, with a playful hint: 'What about your dreams?

Yūki’s voice was so soft it was almost inaudible, as if she was asking herself or perhaps telling us something. She lifted her head, her deep blue eyes calm but carrying an indescribable pain.\n\nWe had been trying. The complete stealth equipment, which once brought her relief from the physical pain and allowed her to roam freely in the virtual world, could not conquer the relentless virus inside her body. AIDS, the disease that claimed the lives of so many, was still silently ravaging her blood.\n\nWe watched her take each step toward the end, helpless. Once, we believed that the power of technology could break all shackles, bring endless possibilities, but at this heartbreaking moment, we finally understood a harsh truth—some diseases, even the most advanced technology cannot fully cure.\n\nDespite our tireless efforts, we had not been able to bring her a miracle. We provided her with every possible technology and the best medical conditions, yet AIDS, with its irresistible force, took her life. She, the girl once filled with hope and vitality, had to part from us.\n\nShe smiled, the corners of her mouth lifted slightly, as if to comfort us. 'You’ve done very well,' her voice carried a soft warmth. 'Actually, I’m very happy. At least I’ve experienced so much, and have so many beautiful memories. I’m not a lonely girl.' She paused, continuing, 'You did it, helped me live better, live longer.'\n\nHer family had long passed away, and shortly after that farewell, they could no longer endure the harshness of the disease. Yūki had been alone, facing everything by herself. Yet, she had never complained to us, and even when faced with the boundary of life and death, she still maintained a strength and openness beyond the ordinary.\n\n'I’m not afraid,' she said softly, as if to herself, but also to us, expressing the unspoken pain. 'My family has already left me. I know they fought to stay as long as they could, just for me. So... I will smile as I leave.'\n\nTears flickered in her eyes, but they were not tears of sadness, but of release, the acceptance of fate. She smiled, looking at the scenes in the virtual world that had once brought her so much joy. She had once galloped through a land full of fantasy and adventure, and today, everything in the virtual world seemed to have become her final solace.\n\n'If in the next life, I can see you again, maybe I’ll continue exploring these questions with you.' Her voice was so faint it could hardly be heard, but it deeply moved everyone present.\n\nFinally, the lab was filled with silence. There were no more words, no more emotional outbursts, only the indescribable pain in everyone's hearts."

But as time passed, we gradually realized—her existence had transformed from just a subject or a 'tester' into something irreplaceable. Every time she used our next-generation stealth technology, it was an invaluable 'practical lesson,' with each session generating live experimental data and breakthrough questions. We could say that every one of Yūki’s efforts has become a catalyst for the progress of our technology.\n\nYūki, the girl who once overcame obstacles in the virtual world, is no longer just a star in that world. She tirelessly participated in the testing of every generation of our technology, from the initial instability to the smooth applications we see today.

She has solved many of our tough technical problems and, unknowingly, proposed unprecedented innovative ideas.\n\nYet, she remains pure and joyful, like any girl in her teens. Whenever we ask her opinion on something, she always answers with ease—no anxiety, no pressure—just fresh and lively thoughts emerging. She never exaggerates her accomplishments, nor does she feel proud for being ahead of others. In her eyes, all difficulties and challenges are adventures, explorations, and opportunities to enjoy the process.\n\nHer optimism and openness have almost become the spiritual pillar of our entire research team.

Moreover, her inspiration has already gone beyond the realm of technology—her insights and ways of thinking have led to profound reflections in philosophy, ethics, and even sociology.\n\nGradually, we realized that Yūki had become an indispensable part of our research work. She was no longer just our experimenter but our mentor, motivating us to innovate more and push more boundaries.

The staff activated the complete immersion device, a technology that not only allowed Mokuki’s consciousness to fly freely but also allowed her family to 'meet' her again in the endless stream of data.\n\nIn the virtual space, the four of them gathered together, seemingly forgetting the heavy shadows of reality, as time was invisibly extended, and they could even feel each other’s body warmth, as if it were within reach. That sensation made Mokuki feel as if she had returned to her distant childhood, laughing with her family, chasing carefree moments. However, she knew this was merely a simulated illusion, and behind the brief warmth was a long and painful farewell.\n\nHer father smiled and patted her head, her mother gently draped her arm over her shoulders, and her sister’s eyes glistened with tears, yet she couldn’t bear to let the tears fall. In this virtual space, they walked together through a series of memories — her first steps, her joy in going to school, and the image of the family sitting together for a warm dinner.

She knew this was their final embrace, but she still couldn’t accept this reality. Her sister gently stroked her face and softly murmured the kind of affectionate jokes only siblings share, as if she wanted to convey all the love and care.\n\nAnd in this painful farewell, her family’s final wish became clear.

PRC_MAO.22.d:0 "After receiving the complete immersion treatment, Konno Mokuki’s life had been reshaped into an almost entirely virtual existence. In reality, her body was frail and could no longer support the carefree childhood she should have had. But in the world of complete immersion, she had gained an extraordinary freedom. Enveloped by the equipment, she was no longer bound by the shackles of the body, and her consciousness gradually took root in the virtual world, exploring a world unlike any other.\n\nStrangely, Mokuki’s adaptability to the complete immersion technology gradually improved, and she reached an unexpectedly high level of proficiency. It seemed as though she was born for this virtual world, with her mind, thoughts, and emotions blending perfectly into the virtual space. With just a thought, she could move, switch, and operate in the virtual world with incredible speed. Even our researchers began to marvel, wondering whether it was the prolonged immersion or her unique adaptability that gave her such outstanding control.\n\nWhat was even more unbelievable was that this girl, barely in her teens, began to show an extraordinary learning ability. When her consciousness combined with the experimental artificial intelligence chip we provided, this technology almost became a part of her, helping her absorb and synthesize knowledge from the virtual world at an astonishing rate. Mathematics, physics, medicine, computer science — she studied them all, as if time no longer mattered to her. Within just a few months, her knowledge level in various fields had reached, and even surpassed, that of a university graduate, which was truly astounding.\n\nExperimental logs show that Mokuki’s thinking no longer resembled that of an ordinary child. Instead, she displayed the profound understanding and insight of an adult. During her learning process, she was no longer satisfied with surface-level knowledge. She would raise complex questions and seek deeper answers through virtual simulations. She wandered through the virtual library, sifting through countless documents and materials, as if her heart found unprecedented satisfaction in the vast ocean of data. Her exploration of every subject was not superficial, but went to the core, gradually building her own understanding system and forming her unique insights.\n\nIn one experiment log, Mokuki even discussed her thoughts on the origins of the universe and the diversity of biological evolution with the researchers. The conversation was stunning, and the researchers were captivated by her mature and broad thinking. It felt as though she was not just a student, but a calm and composed seeker of knowledge, full of curiosity about the world and deep understanding."

PRC_MAO.21.d:0 "Among the piles of volunteer applications, one unexpected application quietly lay on the table. In the document, a Japanese girl named Konno Mokuki had her parents passionately and concisely describe the hardships of her short life. We learned that this girl, barely in her teens, had never known an ordinary childhood, and even simple health was a luxury she could only dream of.\n\nMokuki’s mother had undergone a caesarean section due to a difficult birth and, unfortunately, contracted the HIV virus during an emergency blood transfusion. This terrible misfortune not only flowed through her body but also mercilessly tormented her family. Her parents and sister did their best to sustain her life, wrapping this fragile existence in love and care. However, when she was in the fourth grade of elementary school, the secret was no longer a secret. The school’s students and parents discovered her HIV-positive status, and once-innocent friendships were replaced by coldness, with whispers pricking her heart like needles. She was forced to transfer schools, and in the new environment, she could never escape the shadow of loneliness. Doctors believed that the immense pressure and discrimination she faced eventually led to her immune system breaking down, triggering AIDS.\n\nNow, Mokuki’s parents, once again exhausted, spent several days to finally submit her application to our research institute. They held on to their last hope, having heard of the 'complete immersion' technology we were developing, which might allow Mokuki to feel a touch of the warmth of a healthy life in the virtual world. Despite her frail body, they hoped that through the help of the immersion technology, her soul could run freely, play, and live without fear of illness, just like ordinary people.\n\nHowever, the technology was still in the experimental stage, and deciding whether to include such a fragile yet incredibly resilient girl in the experiment was a heavy decision. Mokuki’s physical condition was not optimistic. She had endured frequent medication and torment over the past few years. This application was not just about a research slot but seemed like a desperate cry for hope — she longed for a freedom that couldn’t be touched, a 'reality' in the virtual world.\n\nShould we give this girl a glimmer of hope and let her join this exploration of the unknown?"

PRC_advanced_economic_planning_8_desc: "With the brilliant progress of Complete Immersion Technology, a grand vision quietly emerged, reshaping the blueprint for modern democracy. This is an unprecedented form of direct democracy, no longer relying on traditional layers of representative systems, but allowing each citizen to directly face the decision-making process — they will participate personally in every national issue, based on their own thoughts and will. Through Complete Immersion devices, every citizen can enter a virtual parliament, as if they were physically present, engaging in discussions on significant issues.\n\nDigital democracy gives true sovereignty to the citizens. The parliament is no longer a place for a few elites, but is open to all people. Everyone can express their views through immersive devices, from rural workers to grassroots scholars, all voices are gathered here. Various opinions, proposals, and ideas are analyzed, categorized by artificial intelligence, and similar views are integrated before the final decision, eliminating bias. This intelligent system is efficient and meticulous, able to summarize diverse public opinions into clear decision-making directions with broad consensus.\n\nIn this highly participatory mechanism, important national affairs are no longer decided by a few representatives. Instead, every citizen has the opportunity, within the framework of the constitution, to propose plans for the future of the country. They can not only present ideas but also witness every stage of the decision-making process. It’s like a huge 'VR Assembly' — an immersive assembly hall, carrying the collective will and wisdom of billions of people. At this moment, citizens are no longer mere spectators but active participants and builders, laying a solid foundation for true popular sovereignty. This vision will become a pioneer for global democracy, providing a new model for governance in socialist nations."
PRC_advanced_economic_planning_7: "Investing in Complete Immersion Technology"
PRC_advanced_economic_planning_7_desc: "The future belongs to nations that master the limits of sensory technology. With breakthroughs in holography, artificial intelligence, and sensory devices, the rise of Complete Immersion Technology will revolutionize human experience of reality. This technology will use advanced sensors and neural connection techniques, enabling individuals to perceive virtual environments' temperature, touch, and even smell without physical contact. This is not only the pinnacle of entertainment and virtual reality but also the new frontier for medicine, education, military, and technical training.\n\nIn medicine, Complete Immersion Technology will bring revolutionary changes to rehabilitation and psychological treatment. By simulating real-world environments, patients can undergo rehabilitation training in a controlled, pain-free virtual environment, gradually restoring both physical and mental health. This approach reduces treatment costs and enhances patient safety and comfort. Similarly, this technology can be used for fine-tuned training for surgeons, enhancing medical skills through virtual surgical practice without actual human operation, significantly improving the overall efficiency of the healthcare system.\n\nMoreover, Complete Immersion Technology plays an irreplaceable role in military and industrial training. Soldiers, pilots, and special forces personnel will be able to experience simulated combat in real environments, no longer limited by traditional training equipment, reducing risks during training and improving reaction speed and combat readiness. For industrial technicians, this technology will shorten the learning curve, enabling practice on dangerous equipment without physical contact, preparing them for future high-risk tasks.\n\nThe potential of this innovative technology goes far beyond this — it is a stepping stone toward an intelligent economy and a knowledge society. By investing in Complete Immersion Technology, we not only take the lead in the global technological competition but also inject new momentum into the national economy, laying a solid foundation for the comprehensive development of the new era."
PRC_advanced_economic_planning_6: "Comprehensive Development of Clean Energy"
PRC_advanced_economic_planning_6_desc: "In this era of increasingly fierce global resource competition, China must break free from its reliance on foreign energy. At present, our energy production system still heavily depends on the import of oil and natural gas, subject to fluctuations in international market prices, which hinders the nation’s development. To address this risk and push the country into a new era of energy autonomy and cleanliness, the comprehensive development of clean energy has become an urgent priority.\n\nChina’s vast territory and abundant natural resources provide us with an unparalleled advantage in developing clean energy. Clean energy plans, centered on solar, wind, hydro, and geothermal power, will create a self-sustaining, low-emission energy circulation system that spans production, transmission, and use. Heavy investments in solar panels, wind turbines, and storage systems will not only meet domestic demand but will also enable us to dominate the future energy market. Simultaneously, through the gradual phase-out of high-pollution, high-consumption old energy industries, we will effectively reduce carbon emissions, laying the foundation for green development.\n\nThe rise of clean energy is not only about environmental protection but also about national strategic security. A China no longer dependent on imported energy will have the confidence to face international sanctions and resource limitations. By strengthening research and innovation, encouraging public and private capital participation, and optimizing the electricity grid and storage systems, we will build a pollution-free, low-cost, and highly efficient clean energy system, ensuring the long-term stability and prosperity of the country."
PRC_advanced_economic_planning_5: "Abolishing the Household Responsibility System"
PRC_advanced_economic_planning_5_desc: "Since the disbanding of the commune system, the foundation of socialism in China has gradually crumbled. Initially, when the Household Responsibility System was implemented, Deng’s 'reformists' temporarily won the support of farmers by raising the purchase price of agricultural products, creating an illusion of increased production. However, the reality gradually exposed that the household contracting system did not bring true prosperity. Instead, it imposed extremely high agricultural taxes and heavy burdens, gradually trapping rural areas in a dire situation. A massive labor force migrated to cities, strengthening the urban-rural dual separation policy, deepening the divide between rural and urban areas, even to the point of resembling 'apartheid' — rural and urban areas became two separate worlds, distant and disconnected.\n\nTo solidify this rural-urban divide, the government established numerous 'camps' to restrict the freedom of migrant populations, suppressing people’s right to migrate, and treating rural areas as an economic burden. The development of rural areas stagnated, with significant talent loss and increasing poverty. The system's supposed 'liberation' had actually become a shackling force for rural areas. In order to achieve sustainable agricultural development and bring farmers back into the socialist collective economy, it is imperative to abolish the Household Responsibility System."
PRC_advanced_economic_planning_4: "Streamlining the Civil Service System"
PRC_advanced_economic_planning_4_desc: "With the advancement of automated planned economy, the reform of the national civil service system has become imminent. We have decided to gradually replace the complex and repetitive low-efficiency positions with highly encrypted artificial intelligence systems. The introduction of this system will not only reduce redundant personnel and cut labor costs but also eliminate corruption loopholes previously created by human operation with its strict monitoring and the absolute neutrality of algorithms. This new system integrates seamlessly into every operational process, from routine approvals to financial transactions, ensuring the efficiency and transparency of information flow, and providing decision-makers with a clear view of the system's operations.\n\nEvery piece of civil service flow is automatically executed within the system’s encrypted program, without human intervention, thoroughly removing any form of 'personal connections' or 'backdoor dealings.' On this basis, public services become more precise and efficient, with any individual's needs being promptly addressed. The government, through this intelligent system arrangement, has completely reduced the space for corruption. Artificial intelligence not only efficiently handles daily affairs but also acts as an overseer, recording every operation and providing real-time feedback to higher authorities, ensuring everything is traceable and preventing the breeding of corruption.\n\nBy streamlining the civil service system, we not only save public expenditure and release a large amount of human resources but also reshape the national governance structure at a deeper level, making it more efficient, fair, and impartial with the assistance of artificial intelligence. This reform will become the cornerstone of future economic development, bringing prosperity to the entire society while truly benefiting the people."
PRC_advanced_economic_planning_3: "Intelligent Data Coordination Enterprises"
PRC_advanced_economic_planning_3_desc: "The economic planning of the new era is no longer a simple supply and demand equation but a resource revolution centered around data. In this intelligent data coordination framework, we will leverage the internet and artificial intelligence to coordinate massive user data, providing precise empowerment to large-scale enterprises. Through comprehensive big data sharing, every piece of user information becomes a resource, transmitted in real-time to certified enterprises, making information flow like blood within the economy, breaking down barriers and giving companies unprecedented efficiency.\n\nWith the power of data, we not only save businesses expensive operating costs but also make targeted promotion the norm. Intelligent algorithms predict consumer preferences, habits, and needs to ensure that users receive the most relevant product information at the most opportune moment. Enterprises gain growth potential, and consumers benefit from a wider range of choices and superior value-for-money, making resource distribution more efficient and optimized. Consumption will no longer be redundant; every transaction is calculated carefully, balancing investment and output at the optimal point.\n\nThis is not only a reshaping of the traditional economic model but also an acceleration of currency circulation. Every piece of data, every decision is a precise control over time and resources, speeding up the economic cycle. The support of intelligent data is like a compass, guiding enterprises, users, and markets into a new era of collaborative efficiency, injecting fresh vitality into the overall economy."

Our revolutionary will is not like the formalized changes of the Soviet East and Europe, nor will it be a superficial change where a new flag merely hides the old corruption. The CCP once ruled in the name of 'special characteristics,' accumulating countless debts, exploiting, oppressing, and building mountains of hypocrisy, all of which have led to irreversible historical catastrophes. The blood debts are deep, unforgivable, and have long foretold the inevitable reckoning.\n\nIn this action to reshape the nation, we will not stop at merely dissolving and abolishing the name of the organization. We will go deeper into every government agency, every grassroots level, and launch a comprehensive cleansing to ensure that all the decayed remnants rooted in the privileged system are completely eradicated. We must erase the name 'CCP,' this poisonous legacy, from the political stage of China, fundamentally severing its penetration into society, so that it will never have a chance for restoration.\n\nThe order of the new China should be built on the foundation of genuine democracy and fairness, not on the empty shell of a government that has already lost the people’s trust. Every position change, every reform bill, is a revolutionary promise, a repayment to the people. Our goal is not merely to change the name of a government but to completely erase this regime, making it a closed chapter in history, locked away in discarded memories. The land of China will completely sweep away this shadow, and the true freedom and justice that belongs to the people will shine eternally on this land."

But amidst this new atmosphere, a curious discovery was quietly made: when visiting some elderly people's homes, some young people were surprised to notice that the elders seemed to be carefully hiding something. It was said that in the secret corners of certain old revolutionaries' homes, early Mao Zedong badges were spotted, while in other places, red badges and miniature statues were carefully wrapped and hidden deep inside drawers, seemingly afraid of being discovered, and more afraid of being 'confiscated.'\n\nThis curious incident quickly spread, drawing media attention and even making the headlines. The debate over the fate of 'Mao images' and 'red badges' sparked a discussion online. Some called for respecting the emotions of the older generation, believing these items symbolized historical imprints and nostalgia; others argued that since the new era has arrived, the worship of the past should be completely abandoned to avoid misleading future generations.\n\nAs the public opinion continued to escalate, the government finally intervened with a thoughtful announcement. The announcement was concise but carried a tone of deep care and understanding, responding to the people's concerns:\n\n'Regarding the memorial items of the late leader, the government has never and will never require individuals to surrender their personal badges, portraits, and other such items. For the nation, these items belong to the realm of private emotions; the government has neither the right nor the intention to intervene, nor will it confiscate them.'\n\nThe notice clarified that only 'personality cults initiated and promoted by the government in any form' were prohibited. The announcement even softly reminded, 'Everyone carries a touch of red in their memory, not to be erased, but to become a spark in their hearts, rather than a towering idol.'\n\nFor a moment, the entire internet fell into silence, as if contemplating the deeper meaning of these words. Soon, some shared the notice with their elders, and those who had once carefully hidden their 'red treasures' finally smiled with relief. They brought out the slightly rusty badges, as if displaying their most cherished memories and recounting the passion and glory of that era. Some even hung these badges in prominent places in their homes, wiping them clean and bright again, as if performing a silent ritual.\n\nThe official stance gave everyone a sigh of relief. On the streets, in tea houses, people began various discussions around the notice. Some called it 'the people's awakening,' while others called it 'the respect of the new era.' Regardless of opinions, those items with the imprints of history — badges, portraits, statues — had become something special in the hearts of the Chinese people. They were no longer symbols of power, but a continuation of emotion."

The day was overcast, with the wind blowing, as if carrying a distant sigh. People gazed at the scene before them, some in a daze — Mao Zedong’s body, which had once rested in the memorial hall, had long become a symbol. Today, in accordance with his last wishes, it was taken out and brought to its final resting place for cremation. Who could have imagined that this moment would truly arrive?\n\nFrom now on, Beijing's Mao Zedong Memorial Hall will no longer be guarded in the name of an individual but will be redefined as the People’s Heroes Memorial Hall, standing alongside the People’s Heroes Monument. Inside, the walls will bear Mao Zedong’s achievements, his image as the leader of the revolution and the people will remain there. His name will be etched alongside many nameless heroes who gave their lives for the Republic. Mao Zedong, along with those lost revolutionaries, will be forever remembered, not as a towering figure above, but as part of the collective memory of the people.\n\nMeanwhile, the winds of change swept across the country, and statues of past leaders began to be gradually dismantled. In some areas, people spontaneously gathered in squares, unable to hide their reluctance. They brought flowers and quietly stood beneath the familiar statues, as if bidding farewell to an old friend. Workers used cranes to hoist the steel cables, and the statue slowly toppled, the surrounding audience teary-eyed, with respectful applause echoing. It was the last physical manifestation of Mao Zedong on this land, but his thoughts had already deeply taken root in the hearts of the people.\n\nHowever, in some places, the removal of statues took on a different form. In Shenzhen's Lotus Hill Park, the statue of Deng Xiaoping was surrounded by angry young people. They raised various tools, hammers, crowbars, and even stones, with uncontrollable emotions, striking the once-admired figure. Some couldn’t help but spit at the statue, cursing 'characteristics' and 'corruption.' This complex emotion was fully released during the dismantling, turning into a form of venting, as if to say a final goodbye to past shadows."

People gathered on the green field, dressed in brightly colored team uniforms, with the shouts of the crowd and waving flags filling the air. However, the main attraction of this event was not a star player, but a specially designed football — Confucius’ image was painted on the ball, with his familiar beard and scholarly face, slowly becoming blurred as it spun quickly, turning into a symbolic target in the eyes of the audience.\n\nThis football match, called the 'Anti-Confucius Cup,' was not merely a sports competition, but a challenge to the old cultural symbols. The Confucius-headed football was not an homage to the sage but a deeply sarcastic jest. Many young people eagerly talked about the Anti-Confucius Movement of 1966, viewing those tumultuous years as a symbol of breaking tradition and pursuing equality. Today, this symbol reappeared in a mocking manner, as if the ancient city of Qufu had never anticipated witnessing such a revolutionary wave once more.\n\nThe tense atmosphere on the field was filled with the intertwining of history and reality. The players ran back and forth, kicking the 'Confucius head' in all directions, accompanied by the crowd’s shouts and applause. Each kick seemed to carry a rebellious air, as if declaring war on the deeply rooted Confucian thoughts. Off the field, many citizens discussed the special match, as if it were not just a game, but a collective release, a celebration of new ideas.\n\nHowever, the event was not without controversy. Taiwan took a very serious stance on the 'Anti-Confucius Cup,' condemning the event as an affront to traditional culture and disrespect to Chinese history. Several media outlets in Taiwan published stern criticisms, calling for 'the protection of Confucius' dignity,' and claimed that this behavior from the mainland was 'desecrating ancestors,' a blow to the cultural foundation. Taiwanese politicians frequently expressed their views, even implying that such actions could impact cross-strait relations and provoke dissatisfaction among traditional supporters.\n\nBut the young people of Qufu were undeterred, their enthusiasm only growing stronger."

The once shared struggles had brought him together with many revolution comrades to this point; however, at this juncture, he had to ask himself if it was time to walk the path alone.\n\nHe lowered his head, his fingertips lightly tapping the table. The public sentiment and accumulation of power over the past few months undoubtedly gave him enough confidence, whether he continued leading the alliance or appeared as an independent candidate, he was almost guaranteed victory. However, at this moment, Han Dongfang was not just concerned with power itself but with how that power would be exercised, whether after the election, he could still maintain control over the country and lead it forward.\n\nA soft breeze gently blew through the curtains, lifting a faint dust, like the passionate years of the past. Han Dongfang once firmly established his ideals through the nightly debates in the Workers' Autonomy Union and the shouts at street rallies. But now, he knew that relying solely on slogans and revolutionary passion was no longer enough to lead this fractured country. The existence of the alliance meant a stable assurance, a buffer for coexisting factions. Once the alliance was dismantled, the future would remain uncertain, with factional conflicts possibly surging like a tide.\n\nHe closed his eyes, the faces of his companions flashing in his mind, some young comrades with revolutionary fire in their eyes, others older, their calm and rationality shaped by the trials of time. Some supported radical reform, others advocated a more gradual transition, but regardless of their stance, they were all waiting for his decision, waiting for him to set the tone for the future of the country.\n\nA bell rang faintly in the distance, the night deepening. He clenched his fist, as if making a decision, then slowly relaxed. Whether to maintain the stability of the alliance or run independently, he would take all those who trusted him down this unknown road. He knew that whatever choice he made, after this election, a new journey would begin — either calm or stormy.

In this new economic model, we will take a decisive step towards real communism, moving towards a path of freedom and liberation.\n\nEvery machine and every data flow will become an extension of labor in this automated system. Resource redistribution will no longer be confined to decisions made by a few individuals, but will be fully coordinated by the needs of the people and the wisdom of the state. Humans will gradually be freed from the burdens of labor and will be able to engage in creative activities. Means of production and commodities will no longer be subject to the invisible hand of the market but will be precisely controlled by central calculation models, eliminating waste and disorder, and enhancing overall societal well-being.\n\nThis model will inject tremendous vitality and efficiency into productivity, driving a complete transformation of the nation from its economic to social structures.

Today, the wheels of history roll forward, and the new flower of freedom blooms in the vast eastern land, while preparations for the national election mark the new phase of this revolution. Farewell to despotism and high walls, the new era has arrived — a government truly by and for the people is about to be born. The brilliant future is no longer a distant dream but a reality within reach.\n\nIn this upcoming election, whether workers, peasants, or intellectuals, everyone will have a voice, entrusting their hopes to the future regime. Countless reformers are ready to present their ideals and blueprints, while the winds of freedom sweep across the land, washing away outdated thoughts and ushering in a new wave of social change.\n\nPreparations across the country are in full swing, from cities to rural areas, political opinions are diverse, and viewpoints are plentiful. Whether social democrats, radical leftists, or free thinkers, every idea and every voice will be showcased and debated here. This election will be a grand dialogue about the future, focusing on how China can achieve peace, regain vitality, and allow every citizen to live a peaceful and prosperous life. The future leaders will emerge from this democratic trial.\n\nPeople begin to imagine that a society where everyone can express themselves, participate, and govern is about to arrive. The election is not just the process of selecting a leader, but a journey to awaken the people. Every vote will bring hope, and this generation will witness the new China they have created with their own hands."

PRC_revive_iron_rice_bowl_1: "Socialized Upbringing"
PRC_revive_iron_rice_bowl_1_desc: "On the land of New China, socialized upbringing will assume an entirely new form, completely overturning the traditional ties between family and child-rearing. As part of the new revolution, 'socialized upbringing' aims to break the deep-rooted patriarchy and the shackles placed by families on individuals. Socialized upbringing is not only a tool for liberating women and youth but also a new force injecting vitality into society as a whole.\n\nIn this new era, children are no longer merely a private burden of families but a shared responsibility of the entire society. The state will gradually establish a public upbringing network covering both urban and rural areas, investing significant social resources to provide every child with a worry-free growing environment. Governments, communities, and workplaces will all participate in providing education and basic life support, ensuring that children’s health and development no longer depend solely on individual or family economic conditions. Through public education, healthcare, and welfare, we will relieve the younger generation of burdens, allowing them to focus on their own growth and development without being held back by the heavy load of raising children.\n\nThe implementation of socialized upbringing signals a gradual transformation of traditional family structures, where the historical remnants of patriarchy will begin to disintegrate. Children are no longer the private property of any family but the shared wealth of the entire society. Young people will be liberated from family constraints, able to choose love freely, pursue careers independently, without having to worry about raising children or supporting elderly relatives. This societal reform will not only increase the birth rate and alleviate population pressure but also bring unprecedented intellectual freedom and the liberation of productivity to society, allowing every individual to pursue their self-worth more freely."

PRC_the_Flower_of_Freedom_1_desc: "After decades of struggles, suffering, and thorns, the Chinese people have finally welcomed the dawn of this land of hope. From the sorrowful day of 1989 to today’s arrival of dawn, we have undergone countless struggles and fights, but the fire of freedom in our hearts has never gone out. Those dark years witnessed the shadow of oppression hanging over our land, witnessed the people’s pursuit of freedom being ruthlessly crushed. However, it was in this profound pain that the seed of hope was sown. Today, it has broken through the ground and is fiercely blooming in every street, every village, and every mountain.\n\nToday’s victory is not only a counterattack against oppression but also a solemn tribute to all the pioneers who fought for freedom. Those people who stood up in times of hardship, those ideals nurtured with blood, have finally blossomed on this fertile land. The future is a pristine land that has not yet been touched, waiting for every Chinese person to draw its blueprint. The people are no longer just spectators of history but creators of the new era.\n\nThe new China will be a vibrant soil. There are no shackles of despotism, only the fragrance of democracy and freedom. We can now imagine, under this brand new sky, the light of justice will eventually shine upon the earth, and the ideals of equality will rise like the morning sun. Let the sufferings of the past become our strength for the future, and let the countless sacrifices be etched in our hearts! Each person will no longer be just a passerby in history but the master of this new world."

PRC_MAO.16.d:0 "In the solemn revolutionary courtroom, Wang Huning, dressed in prison clothes, stood with his head bowed in the center of the dock. In front of him were the policies and ideals he once upheld, now the basis for his crimes. The courtroom was filled with calm people’s representatives, waiting for him to defend all that he had orchestrated. The judge on the podium struck the gavel heavily, the sound like thunder: 'Defendant Wang Huning, listen carefully.'\n\nWang Huning slightly raised his head, his face pale, his voice hoarse: 'I’m listening, go ahead.'\n\n'What do you have to say in your defense? You may speak now.'\n\nWang Huning's lips trembled slightly, but he remained silent. He knew his defense had little place in this courtroom. After a few seconds of silence, he spoke in a calm tone, yet with a hint of tension: 'This could be, that’s your so-called 'many facts,' but isn’t it just picking at the egg shells and finding faults…'\n\nThe courtroom erupted in murmurs, but Wang Huning continued, his speech quickening, as if trying to justify himself: 'Everything I did was for China’s ‘stability.’ Stability above all else, is there something wrong with that? Doesn’t China’s revival need a stable environment? When I set policies for the country, I considered the people, the interests of all the people. And now, you’re painting me as—Fascist? This is absurd!'\n\n'Absurd?' the judge coldly interrupted, his gaze sharp as a knife, 'Who’s rights did your so-called stability take away? Whose freedom did it sacrifice? What exactly is the stability you speak of, and whose authority did it maintain? The people’s, or the interests of your 'special' operators?'\n\nBefore he could finish, murmurs from the audience erupted: 'He is a fascist! He speaks nicely but treats us like puppets!' Another one coldly mocked: 'This is our 'national guru,' trampling on the dignity and lives of so many people for the so-called stability!'\n\nWang Huning was immediately silenced, as if all words were rendered meaningless. The trial in the revolutionary courtroom was not merely a legal process, but a voice of justice forged by the people’s anger. The nation’s idealistic vision, once woven with eloquence, now stripped away, revealing absurdity and cruelty.\n\nThe judge coldly declared: 'Wang Huning, as the 'special' operator and 'national guru,' all your crimes will ultimately face the judgment of the people. Your 'stability' has become a brand of history, heavy and unforgivable.'"

PRC_MAO.15.d:0 "On a silent and cold night, Beijing was covered in thick darkness, with all things still. Only the occasional breeze swept through the empty streets. Yet, under this calm night, a silent storm was brewing. Ren Chonghao’s staunch supporters, planning carefully and moving step by step, closely united under his command, were quietly assembling, bringing with them an unstoppable will, approaching the Great Hall of the People.\n\nTheir footsteps were silent like shadows, with every detail rehearsed in advance—whether it was the route through winding streets or methods to evade patrolling guards, everything was calculated to the finest degree. The guards surrounding the Great Hall were caught off guard by this sudden attack. The figures in the dark swiftly and mercilessly crossed the security line, like silent and deadly waves, rushing toward the imposing, cold structure of the Great Hall.\n\nThey broke through the final barrier, swept forward with intense passion, rushing into the new center of revolutionary power. In this hall, symbolizing both the people and the regime, deep corridors and grand columns were instantly controlled by this raging force. Amidst flickering lights, these loyal followers moved across the spacious marble floor, ruthlessly destroying revolutionary symbols, as if tearing down everything, leaving only the image in their hearts.\n\nThis was not a symbolic action, but a real and cold assault, leaving no room for breath. The Great Hall of the People, once a symbol of the new government’s power, was now swept away by Ren Chonghao and Xiong Houzhi’s forces in a lightning strike, seemingly sealing away the new government’s revolutionary promise. The flames of revolution were extinguished, replaced by iron blood and ruthlessness."

PRC_MAO.14.t:0 "New Leader"
PRC_MAO.14.d:0 "In the early morning light, the results of the second People's Republic of China election quietly appeared on the front page headlines of various websites — 'Qin Hui narrowly defeats Han Dongfang, becoming the new leader.' In this tense and fierce election, Han Dongfang lost by a slim 5% margin. As a once-leading revolutionary figure, he was undoubtedly a hero of the era. However, in this election, voices for and against him had clashed, and ultimately, the winds of time pushed another ambitious politician to the top.\n\nThe morning breeze swept through the capital’s streets, carrying a slight chill. Han Dongfang slowly opened the window, gazing out at the awakening city, feeling a bitter and relieved sensation in his heart. He did not feel anger at losing the leadership position; on the contrary, this subtle defeat brought him an unprecedented sense of ease. Several years ago, he personally led the revolution that overthrew the decaying old regime, guiding the Chinese people through the clash between ideals and reality. However, the ideal of social democracy had failed to fully transform this land, and many policies still hadn’t touched the core of the people’s lives.\n\nHan Dongfang knew that although he laid the foundation for the revolution, he also couldn’t escape the difficulties during his time in power: slow economic growth, difficulties in improving the social welfare system, and entrenched conservative forces still lingering. The dream of social democracy moved too slowly under his leadership, too many matters remained unfinished, and he deeply understood the expectations piling up among the people. At this moment, he quietly admitted that Qin Hui’s emergence might be the real change needed.\n\nMeanwhile, in the election hall, Qin Hui stood on the stage, accepting the flashes of the cameras and the applause of countless supporters. He, once a rebel, now stood at the highest position with both humility and confidence. His campaign slogan was simple yet powerful: 'Freedom and Welfare.' With unique ideas and decisive actions, he won the hearts of the people, especially the younger generation. Today, he finally stood where he had imagined countless times, taking on the mission of making China more open, inclusive, and vibrant.\n\nHan Dongfang looked at the cheering crowd and saw Qin Hui taking the red flag symbolizing leadership. A complex calm arose in his heart. He did not regret it; on the contrary, he genuinely hoped for his successor. Qin Hui, who once debated and fought alongside him, would lead the country into a future he had not reached. The road ahead for this country may be rocky, today the people chose a different direction, and Han Dongfang would choose to respect that.\n\nHan Dongfang’s vision slowly blurred, unsure whether it was the morning chill or this long-lost peace. He slowly withdrew his gaze, walked out of the room, and headed towards the street."

PRC_MAO.13.t:0 "Rehabilitation"
PRC_MAO.13.d:0 "Song Yongyi sat silently at the desk, holding the document that had just been handed to him. His fingers trembled slightly. On the desk lay an official document — a Rehabilitation Letter, with the heading clearly stating: 'Rehabilitation Letter — Comrade Song Yongyi.' The handwriting was neat, stamped with a bright red seal, as if carrying the weight of history, both mocking and yet a rare redemption.\n\nHe could hardly believe his eyes. He, Song Yongyi, had long severed ties with the 'extreme left' era, even publicly declared his support for liberalism, and now, he had received such a formal rehabilitation letter? A deep sense of absurdity climbed into his heart, soon overshadowed by disbelief. He looked up at the person who handed him the document, his eyes filled with uncontainable confusion.\n\n'What kind of joke is this?' he asked in a low voice, his tone trembling slightly, as if speaking to himself or seeking an unexpected explanation. 'Why me? Haven’t I long since distanced myself from those extreme leftists?'\n\nThe young man handing over the document was calm and firm, with a perfectly timed smile. 'Mr. Song, you were part of the rebels in the past, that’s a historical fact. No matter what stance you took later, your history with the rebels cannot be erased, nor will it be wiped out because of any subsequent changes.'\n\n'But this is a new government, right?' Song Yongyi frowned slightly, pondering for a moment before lowering his voice and asking, 'If you don’t acknowledge the previous regime, then why apologize for past events? Isn’t this illogical?'\n\nThe young man slowly responded, his voice filled with a sense of resolve, as if carrying a solemn mission. 'The new government, of course, draws a line with the revisionist government starting from 1976. But what we inherit is the government that once explored and innovated. What we continue is the revolutionary spirit that never bowed to the flow of history. Therefore, today we apologize to the rebels like you, not only to settle past wrongs but also to restore the true revolutionary spirit.'\n\nSong Yongyi was silent for a moment, his gaze scanning the document. The words 'Revolutionary Heretic' suddenly pierced his eyes, shocking him with an unexpected impact.\n\nHe gripped the document tightly, a long-forgotten emotion rising in his chest, complex and contradictory. This document seemed to carry a deep meaning, as if hinting that the country he once knew, yet now felt unfamiliar with, was quietly undergoing a change — no longer hiding past mistakes, but daring to face the tragedies of history.\n\nAfter a moment, he looked at the young man before him. The complex emotions in his eyes gradually faded, replaced by deep contemplation."

PRC_MAO.12.t:0 "Visitor"
PRC_MAO.12.d:0 "Song Yongyi stood at the exit of Shanghai Pudong Airport, his heart filled with unease. The crowd in front of him was noisy and unfamiliar. Though this had once been his homeland, after years of living abroad, his return today felt like a journey to another world. The memories this country had given him were bitter: the passion of the Red Guards in his youth, the heartbreak of leaving in disappointment, and the doubts and obstacles faced while building databases overseas — all like an unshakable cloud. However, this time, the call to return was driven by the Chinese government's plan to launch the historical database project, and the long-lost sense of responsibility once again surged within him. At this moment, he didn’t know what awaited him. Would everything repeat itself?\n\nAs he passed through security, a sudden chill gripped his heart, and his mind raced with possibilities: Censorship? Surveillance? Detention? He had even mentally prepared himself that, if taken away, this might be his final connection to this land. But just then, a familiar figure appeared in the crowd. It was Qin Hui — once a fellow rebel, filled with the same fervor for radical ideals in that era, now the leader of China’s left-wing liberals. Qin Hui’s smile approached, gentle yet sincere, as if to dissipate the decades of shadows in Song Yongyi’s heart.\n\n'Mr. Song, welcome back,' Qin Hui said, extending his hand.\n\nSong Yongyi froze for a moment, then laughed, shaking his hand and feeling the warmth he hadn’t felt in years. All his doubts seemed to vanish in that instant. Looking at Qin Hui, he felt an unexpected sense of reassurance and stability. He whispered, 'Qin Hui, is it really you? I didn’t expect it to be you. Honestly, I didn’t think you’d take their position.'\n\n'Haha, it’s really me,' Qin Hui replied with a smile, his gaze kind and determined. 'Like you, I once rebelled for ideals, and I was once disappointed by those people. But don’t be surprised. Since they’re willing to accept us now, I’ll at least give it a try. As for you, history has its twists, and it also has its truths. Now we have the chance to explore that sealed history and reveal its true face. The Chinese government wants to cooperate with you. This time, you can see another side of that history with your own eyes.'\n\nUpon hearing this, Song Yongyi’s feelings were complex and excited. He had never imagined returning to China at such a moment, being invited to cooperate with the government. He had always carried bitterness from the past, remaining wary of the system, but Qin Hui’s trust gave him a new sense of hope, as if the shadow of history was being gradually dispelled by the warmth of this ally. The two exchanged a smile, as if returning to the passionate days of their youth, but with a maturity and calmness that surpassed that time.\n\n'Song Yongyi, rest assured, this time, we’re not here to make you suffer. We’re here to take responsibility for truth, for history,' Qin Hui said with a slight smile, his gaze sincere. Then, he spoke slowly, 'I know about the situation in America, and I’m personally requesting you to stay. You can rest assured, I guarantee your safety and freedom.'\n\nSong Yongyi was silent for a moment before nodding. He thought about the database he had built, the materials he had collected over the years, and finally understood that perhaps this was where they truly belonged. He looked at Qin Hui, a trace of curiosity in his eyes."

PRC_baihuaqifang_5: "‘Heresy’ and ‘Extreme Left’ Re-Classification"
PRC_baihuaqifang_5_desc: "In the turbulent waters of the Cultural Revolution, there was a group of people once labeled as 'heretics' or 'extreme left' rebels. They were the stubborn fighters, the lonely warriors challenging the system. However, their fate was always weighed down by heavy pressures: excluded by the official authorities, suppressed by the reactionaries, and even abandoned and oppressed by the mainstream rebels. These people struggled repeatedly in the cracks of history, seeking new paths under brutal oppression, only to be branded as 'reactionaries' or 'capitalists.' Yet, as time has passed, we have finally seen their true nature: they were not reactionaries nor capitalists; they were always revolutionaries, unyielding pursuers of progress.\n\nLater, the ‘special party’ rehabilitated some of these rebels, but this rehabilitation was done with great compromise, merely to appease the surface-level historical disputes. True justice was buried under layers of hypocrisy. Today, standing at the beginning of a new era, the 'special party' and the revolution they once led have become relics of the past, and we have the responsibility to uncover the truth, officially reclassifying their role in history.\n\nThese rebels represented an unyielding spirit, an audacious exploration of the future, and a deep loyalty to social progress. Although they strayed from the revolutionary mainstream of their time, they never abandoned the fundamental ideals of the proletarian revolution. It was their unique perspectives and radical ideas that allowed us, in looking back at history today, to see another possibility. What they fought for is exactly what we continue to strive for today. Restoring the reputation of these brave revolutionaries is our final farewell to the old era and our most steadfast commitment to a new future."
PRC_baihuaqifang_4: "The Second Great Rehabilitation"
PRC_baihuaqifang_4_desc: "Since the revolution was halted in 1976 and the 'special party' took control of China, a twisted rewriting of history has quietly unfolded. Led by Deng and his faction, the special forces reversed black and white, blurred right and wrong, gradually covering up the misdeeds of countless reactionary bureaucrats, even whitewashing and rehabilitating them. The cost of this 'rehabilitation' has been the suppression, trial, and even silencing of true proletarian fighters and revolutionaries, condemning them to the dust of history. Every hero wronged by the 'special white terror,' every revolutionary defamed, will now receive the justice of their deserved rehabilitation.\n\nWe will restart a grand 'second great rehabilitation,' a restoration of history and a powerful counterattack against the distorted truths. Whether it is former anti-revisionist fighters or common people who suffered injustice during various movements, their grievances will be reassessed, and justice will be restored. This rehabilitation will not only address the events distorted since the 1976 revolution but also examine the countless innocent souls persecuted during the 'special' white terror — those branded as reactionaries, driven to despair. Today, justice will return to their side."
PRC_baihuaqifang_3: "Establishing an Open Historical Database"
PRC_baihuaqifang_3_desc: "With the new revolutionary wave sweeping across China, we finally have the courage to unveil the long-sealed curtain and establish a truly open historical database, unlocking and publishing every historical document from 1949 to the present. Just as light dispels darkness, the truth of history will destroy the once-glorified images and reveal the reality hidden beneath the 'brilliance.'\n\nWe will collect official documents, local records, and oral histories, from the rulers’ policy decisions to the daily lives of the people, from the clamor of history to the silent cries, leaving no detail overlooked. Those truths that were once concealed — the distorted revolution, the hidden sacrifices, and the downplayed struggles — will be restored here.\n\nThe significance of this database goes beyond mere record-keeping. It serves as a reminder of past mistakes and sacrifices, showing us the way forward. It is a promise to the people and a hope for the future of China. From now on, whether it is policy decisions, economic fluctuations, or cultural movements, the people will have the right to glimpse this grand historical panorama and become the true masters of history, no longer manipulated listeners."
PRC_revenge_for_nanking_1: "§R Revenge Moment §!"
PRC_revenge_for_nanking_1_desc: "The blood debts of the past have long been engraved in every Chinese heart, an indelible hatred. Nanjing, once stained red with blood over eighty years ago, was ravaged by the Japanese imperial invaders, the city filled with wails, and the innocent suffering etched on every street. Now, Japan has surrendered in the war, finally facing its destined fate. What we face is not just simple surrender, but a former torturer who cruelly mistreated our people and provoked our national dignity.\n\nDifferent lands, unforgivable enemies! This is the deepest cry in the hearts of every Chinese. Our nation will not forget, nor will we forgive. Those painful memories are not scars to be understood or forgotten; they are unresolved cries. Now, the time for revenge has come. Blood for blood, every drop of blood and every wail of pain will be accounted for today.\n\nWe don’t just want an apology; we seek more than just punishment. Our only goal with those who caused us suffering is for them to completely 'disappear.' As long as China’s flag flies over East Asia, as long as the souls of Nanjing have not found peace, we will not stop our pursuit of revenge. This is not only vengeance but the echo of justice, a debt owed to the Chinese people by history."
PRC_baihuaqifang_1: "Denial of Personality Cult"
PRC_baihuaqifang_1_desc: "In the tide of revolution, the shadow of personality cults has been like a deep brand, seemingly impossible to completely fade no matter where or when. Though Mao Zedong personally advocated against the deification of himself during his lifetime, ironically, he too could not escape this cycle of fate. Giant portraits, endless worship — these once made the revolutionary light seem mysterious and profound, but they buried the true meaning of the revolution in layers of smoke, turning living revolutionaries into towering idols.\n\nNow, with the awakening of a new generation of leaders, the tide of the times is once again rising — to lift up the power that rightfully belongs to the people, abandoning those hollow rituals and sacred images. For the fundamental spirit of revolution, and for future revolutionaries not to become harmless statues, we must bravely step onto the path of denying personality cults. True revolution should never be attached to any single image or totem; it is the collective effort of countless nameless individuals, the crystallization of the people’s aspirations, and a constantly evolving and dynamic force.\n\nHistory will witness the revolution breaking free from the shackles of worship, so that revolution is no longer a static myth, but an ever-advancing truth — the red flag that belongs to all people will rise once again in the wave of people’s hearts."
PRC_baihuaqifang_2: "New Century Great Revolution"
PRC_baihuaqifang_2_desc: "In 1976, the once-great experiment, in some sense, ended in failure, but its ideas still shine brightly, leaving an eternal spark for the future. Now, in this new century, we will not simply replicate the past path, but carry out a truly new revolution for the 21st century. As Marx stated: 'All great historical events and figures appear twice. The first time as tragedy, the second time as farce.' Therefore, we must avoid repeating the mistakes of the past, no longer pushing personality cults to extremes, no longer indulging in formal rituals. The people will no longer be lost in blind fervor; instead, the new revolution will be carried out with clarity and wisdom as the proletariat’s revenge.\n\nThere will no longer be 'loyalty dances' or 'model operas,' and there will be no 'great leaders.' The power of the proletariat has now matured and will no longer allow the elite to sell out their interests. Compared to the chaotic, compromising struggles of the previous century, this revolution will be more resolute and powerful. The accumulated contradictions of the 'special system' over the decades have exposed the true faces of the bureaucrats, and they will no longer be able to evade reckoning under the guise of 'treating the illness and saving the people.'\n\nThis revolution will also no longer be a one-sided military suppression of the masses. The confrontation between military leaders and local elites is akin to idle talk. The mighty proletarian force has already awakened, with real armed power to resist oppression. For those bureaucrats who once rampaged, oppressing the common people, this time there will be no so-called 'forgiveness and self-reflection.' The great revolution of the 21st century aims not only to overthrow the decayed ruling system but also to ensure that the new power truly serves the people, establishing a clear and just society and turning the flames of struggle into lasting victory."

PRC_MAO.11.d:0 "In the deep autumn, filled with renewal, China’s land was once again filled with passionate songs and bustling crowds. On the streets and alleys, workers, students, youth, intellectuals, and even some old party members, who had been keeping to themselves, all poured into the streets. They held up red banners with phrases such as 'Anti-Capitalism, Anti-Revisionism,' 'Thorough Liquidation,' and 'Give Me Democracy,' as if burning away the silence of the past decade. In some plazas, crowds raised their fists, singing songs adapted from the 'Marseillaise' in the style of the Paris Commune, their stirring melodies seemingly breaking through the sky.\n\n'The people of China are no longer slaves! We unite under the red flag!' \n\nThe roaring song flooded in from all directions, crossing the alleys of cities, converging into an energetic ocean. People’s faces were filled with unprecedented determination. Many of the marchers even had handwritten notes on their hats, bearing slogans such as 'Oppose Capitalist Restoration.' It was a deep mark left by an era — from the struggles of the 1980s to today, it seemed to have crossed the barriers of time, still burning fiercely in the hearts of the people.\n\nThese slogans expressed the yearning for ideals and the dissatisfaction with the current state. The economic collapse after the Taiwan Strait War had reduced the government’s prestige to its lowest point. The verbal 'left turn' policy seemed weak, unable to cover the regime's failure and embarrassment on the international stage. Former slogans had become today’s mockery, and the worker leader, Han Dongfang, who had not been forgotten, and who had once led the Beijing Workers’ Self-Management Union, now became the hope in the hearts of millions.\n\n'In 1989, we rose up!' The anger in the song stirred memories as people waved flags along the streets, eyes brimming with tears. Some marched to resume the struggle that had been left unfinished over thirty years ago, while others sought a new future under this red flag.\n\nEventually, Hu Chunhua resigned, just like this weary era. In the following years, the worker leader who was once considered a relic of the past — Han Dongfang — resolutely stepped onto the stage. His voice, like thunder, rang out across the square, firmly declaring, 'Today, we will completely eradicate all oppression and injustice, and build a truly people’s China!' \n\nThe crowd erupted into thunderous applause. The long-awaited red flag fluttered in the air, marking the start of a new revolutionary era, as the fervor of the scene resembled a wild dance of destiny."

Now, complaints are heard from all corners, and the flaws of the old system are glaringly obvious. In this period of turmoil, Mao Yuanxin, once thought to be the 'ashes of the previous era,' quietly stepped onto the historical stage. This man, who had been branded as a 'Red Guard' in his youth, is now rallying a group of idealistic 'new Red Guards' — a complete and resolute political adventure is about to unfold.\n\nThe corruption and hollowness brought by the 'special' model will be thoroughly exposed, and the revolutionary call is growing louder — people are no longer content with simple reforms; they long for a fundamental upheaval that will overturn the current situation.\n\nMao Yuanxin will be like a sharp blade, directly targeting the heart of the regime. He will tear open the existing order, letting the red torrent of revolution sweep across this land again. Among his supporters are both the older generation, eager to reclaim the proletariat's voice, and young people who loathe capitalism — all of them are waiting for a signal, a signal that will fundamentally change the future."

The shadow of the old system looms, reform progresses slowly, and the times call for new forces. At this moment, a familiar yet unfamiliar name once again echoes across the land — Han Dongfang, the former leader of the Workers' Self-Management Union, a symbol of the resistance of countless workers and youth against power, now leads a new wave toward the center of the storm.\n\nEvery action is brewing with unpredictable, intense conflicts. The atmosphere in the streets and alleys has already started to shift. Han Dongfang and his supporters believe that only by completely dismantling the power structures bearing the marks of 'special' will true liberation for workers, peasants, and ordinary people be achieved. In the darkness of the night, the workers' flags have quietly started to flutter, the revolutionary flames are gradually igniting, continuing the struggle that had been forced into silence for over thirty years — and this time, they will not fail."

Behind every event lies shocking corruption and negligence, the deaths of innocent lives under the exploitation of the capitalist machine, and the weakening of the foundation of the Republic through decay and degeneration. However, the arrival of revolution marks the opening of a new chapter in history. The era of these 'special' bureaucrats is over, their crimes laid out for judgment, and awaiting them is an inescapable reckoning.\n\nThis revolution will no longer tolerate the evil of capitalism disguised under the name of 'special'; this reckoning is not only a declaration of justice but also a necessary step in the rebirth of the Republic. 'Special' must die because the Republic must live. The people's rage, unstoppable like a tidal wave, will pursue this to the end, until the last 'special' bureaucrat is brought to justice and the future of the Republic shines brightly in the new system."

PRC_MAO.10.d:0 "With our strong assistance, the Korean Peninsula has been transformed, and even the once-isolated North Korea has begun to open up. The connection with our automated network has made its social system more efficient, and the people's lives have become increasingly rich and convenient. The reunified Korean Peninsula is no longer a terrifying memory under the Kim family’s rule but has been reshaped into a vibrant and dynamic region. The people of North Korea, both North and South, have embraced new hope. The screens along the streets flicker with cheers from both the North and the South, celebrating this century-crossing reunification. In this profound social transformation, the people of North Korea especially appreciate China's assistance, as it was we who rescued them from the endless darkness under the Kim regime and brought them into the light.\n\nHowever, the many years of division on the peninsula still leave some with complex feelings about 'unification.' Some residents of North Korea, due to memories of oppression under the Kim family, feel vulnerable and hope to seek more reliable future support by suggesting merging with China to form a 'Korean Autonomous Region,' for long-lasting peace and development. In the South, in cities like Seoul and Busan, many citizens share the same complex emotions. Despite the influence of capitalist propaganda, their hearts are also weary of the South Korea that was once controlled, and unexpectedly, they also support merging with China to avoid direct control by the Pyongyang government, becoming part of China. The convergence of these two different sentiments has formed a tide of voluntary integration into China, shocking the world.\n\nHowever, what lies before us is a significant choice. The people of the peninsula are eager for us to accept their request, which is not just a response to history but also a promise to the future. The issue at hand is not merely territorial expansion but whether we can provide long-term security for those North Korean people who wish for a peaceful life.\n\nAt this moment, do we continue as partners, maintaining the Korean Peninsula in an independent, stable state? Or do we boldly accept their request, officially making it the 'Korean Autonomous Region'? Regardless of the choice, this will be a historical turning point, a promise for the future, and will stir the hearts of billions."

As usual, Kim Ji-hoon wakes up, quickly washes up, and steps out of his apartment to head to work. He walks through the bustling streets, occasionally passing soldiers patrolling in North Korean People's Army uniforms. The soldiers smile and wave at him, and he responds with a wave, feeling a strange sense of reassurance.\n\nNot long ago, the news of the 'North Korean Puppet Marching South' spread through the streets of Seoul, causing panic among the citizens. At that time, Kim Ji-hoon was also extremely anxious, regretting that he had missed the last evacuation bus, fearing that Seoul would become the inferno described in rumors. He repeatedly checked the news, his heart racing, waiting for the nightmare-like 'Northern Rule' to arrive.\n\nHowever, the reality turned out to be different from his expectations. Despite strict wartime measures, with curfews set earlier than before and soldiers patrolling the streets, his life didn’t deteriorate as much as he had imagined. There was no so-called internet blockade, and he could still browse the web freely. There were no 'thought police' knocking at his door, and there was no widespread food shortage. The shelves in supermarkets were still stocked with fresh vegetables and fruits, and daily necessities were supplied as usual. If there was any change, it was that the loans that had once suffocated him suddenly disappeared. The debts in his bank account had been wiped clean! It turned out that the 'Northern rulers' had taken over the capitalists’ companies and banks, announcing that the debts of ordinary citizens would be forgiven.\n\nKim Ji-hoon remembers talking to a few soldiers on the street once, discussing his previous prejudices about the 'North.' He admitted that he had once blindly believed the South Korean government's demonizing propaganda, thinking the North was filled with famine and oppression. The soldiers smiled gently, seemingly unfazed. Some told him that life in the North had indeed been difficult in the past, and during the Kim dynasty, everything was as harsh as the rumors said, with the people suffering under oppression. However, with China's help, North Korea had undergone a remarkable transformation and was no longer the hopeless country, but a vibrant 'land of the people.'\n\nThese conversations flashed in his mind, and he suddenly thought of the many North Korean netizens who had appeared online recently. They were boldly speaking out, discussing economics, culture, and even daily trivia, completely different from the previously closed-off image. When he first saw these, Kim Ji-hoon found it hard to believe, but gradually, he realized these North Korean netizens brought many fresh perspectives, sometimes even more lively and hopeful than the discussions in the South.\n\nToday, he felt unusually relaxed, humming an old song, as if the shadow of war had been dispelled by the gentle light of daily life."

This move has drawn widespread attention and discussion, especially in rural areas of India, where insurgent activities are becoming more frequent. The Indian Communist Party (Maoist), as the primary insurgent force, is seizing this opportunity to incite the masses to resist the existing regime, forming a formidable power.\n\nWith the Chinese military advancing, the Indian army is under dual pressure. On one hand, external military pressure has weakened its defenses; on the other hand, internal insurgencies have thrown the military into chaos. The radical propaganda and organizational capacity of the Indian Communist Party (Maoist) have led many people in rural areas to join the resistance movement, creating a powerful force.\n\nIn this complex situation, the Indian government's response measures seem inadequate. The military not only needs to defend against external threats but also deal with internal chaos, severely challenging the allocation of resources and troops. The chaotic situation has caused confusion within the command system, and soldiers, under multiple pressures, have lost morale, significantly impacting overall combat effectiveness.\n\nCurrently, India faces not only military but also deep political and social challenges. As the situation evolves, India's stability and security will face severe tests.

Singapore’s military was thrown into chaos, with soldiers looking at each other, unsure of how to respond to this unexpected resistance.

The Chinese Communist Party can now deeply intervene in the internal affairs of the Workers' Party of Korea, and the People’s Liberation Army has integrated the Korean People’s Army into its combat system.

PRC_finilize_korean_revolution_1: "Finalize the Korean Revolution"
PRC_finilize_korean_revolution_1_desc: "To truly oppose imperialism, we must expose and completely eliminate the corruption of modern revisionism! We firmly believe that completing the Korean revolution is a key step in the Asian revolution, and this path cannot be disturbed or compromised by modern revisionism. Those who falsely claim the name of revolution while acting as traitors have already lost the trust of the proletariat, and any form of joint action with them is a betrayal of revolutionary principles.\n\nIn this struggle, we must not only promote the proletarian awakening in Korea but also thoroughly eliminate all revisionists disguised as revolutionaries. Korea will become the fortress of anti-imperialism and anti-revisionism. China will provide strong support in this revolution, with armed anti-revision and material assistance to the Korean people’s struggle, bringing the truth of proletarian ideology to every corner of Korea. Only through the baptism of revolutionary fire can Korea truly become the territory of the proletariat.\n\nWe will announce to all: China will never retreat, and the banner of revolution will fly high in Korea!"

We firmly believe that the world must once again witness the flames of proletarian struggle, for only revolution is the true means to change the world. To save the oppressed people and reignite the long-neglected communist ideals, we must not only strengthen our support for those true international comrades but also raise the revolutionary banner globally, spreading China’s red power worldwide!\n\nArmed revolution export has become an urgent task, and our goal is not only to support revolutionaries but also to launch attacks on those capitalist strongholds that oppress the people and suppress the proletariat. Faced with neighboring countries enslaved by bourgeois rule, especially the fascist racists wreaking havoc in Mongolia, we cannot stand idly by. Against these decayed capitalist regimes, the gun will be the most powerful response, and the iron fist of revolution will completely destroy the reactionary forces.\n\nChina will march forward with firm steps, carrying the great ideals of the proletariat, announcing to the world: the flames of revolution will be reignited, and the global revolutionary tide is about to arrive!"
PRC_expand_provincial_autonomy_3: "Encourage Provincial Rebel Factions to Seize Power"
PRC_expand_provincial_autonomy_3_desc: "In a prolonged struggle, though we have achieved victory at the center, China's grassroots still resemble a decaying corpse, urgently needing purification and rebirth. We cannot sit idly by; we must spread the flames of revolution from top to bottom, completely overthrowing all forces that hinder our progress. Faced with the corrupt old order, only the power of the people can drive true social change.\n\nEncouraging rebel factions to seize power means decentralizing power to the grassroots revolutionary forces, igniting the fighting spirit of the masses. Every province and city should become a spark of resistance, forming an unstoppable revolutionary tide. The flames of struggle will burn the decaying corpse, transforming it into the driving force for social progress. We will destroy the old order and let the reborn force rise from the flames, forging a brand new China.\n\nThis is a call for a full-scale civil war, a struggle to completely eliminate all reactionary forces. The people will use their unyielding will and courage to throw themselves into the revolutionary wave. The new China forged in the flames will stand tall at the top of the world, truly achieving proletarian liberation and ascension. March forward boldly, believing that victory will surely belong to us!"
PRC_expand_provincial_autonomy_4: "Support Nationwide Rebel Factions' Coordination to Seize Power"
PRC_expand_provincial_autonomy_4_desc: "Total struggle has become an unavoidable choice for us, and we must clearly realize that the decay and decline of the grassroots, like a tumor, is eroding our great cause, and if not cured, it will lead to the fragmentation of the nation. Therefore, the people of the entire country must unite, break the barriers between regions, and gather strength through a great coordination to jointly eliminate this corrupt force.\n\nSupporting the great coordination of rebel factions means calling for revolutionary forces nationwide to unite and form a unified resistance momentum. Rebel factions in different areas must break their isolated situations, join forces with a common goal and belief, and create a nationwide revolutionary wave. Only through unity can we gather enough strength in this struggle to ensure that the voice of every revolutionary echoes nationwide.\n\nIn this struggle, any fragmented independent action is a betrayal of the revolutionary cause. We must prioritize the overall situation, ensuring that the flames of revolution converge in all places, forming a powerful force to completely destroy all corrupt roots. Purging grassroots corruption and reconstructing from the ashes is the only way we can achieve proletarian liberation. Unity is strength, and only through struggle will we achieve victory!"

PRC_MAO.3.d:0 "It was a deafening dawn. Hu Chunhua and a group of bureaucrats had just woken up, and outside the window, a sea of red banners and crimson waves greeted them. They hastily saw thousands of Righteous Path followers flooding the streets, their fervent gazes piercing the haze like flames. They shouted, 'Burn the decay! Purify the land!' Waving flags symbolizing the 'brilliance of the righteous path,' their steps were synchronized and resolute, their faces set in the cold smiles of zealots.\n\nHan Deqiang, whom he claimed was the 'True Lord of the Righteous Path World,' stood on a high platform, eyes half-closed and arms outstretched, as if awaiting a divine revelation. Suddenly, he opened his eyes and shouted, 'Anyone who blocks the righteous path is a demon! They are the filth of hell! Today, only the fire of purification can bring us paradise on earth!' The followers below echoed passionately, shouting, 'Long live the Righteous Path! Long live Teacher Han!' The sound gathered into a torrent that surged into the sky.\n\n'These madmen...' Hu Chunhua shuddered in the dark room. He understood that Han Deqiang, once dismissed as a harmless 'marginal figure' by him and other bureaucrats, had now turned into a nightmare that devoured everything. The 'Lixing Society,' which they once scoffed at, had now become a hell for the extermination of the bureaucratic class. He looked at his trembling hands, unsure whether to feel anger or despair. Those fanatical followers dressed in Righteous Path uniforms were slowly cornering them with no way out.\n\nThe ordinary people in the streets cowered in their homes, the screams and curses from outside nonstop. 'They are demons! They are selfish! Burn all the demons!' The followers searched the streets indiscriminately, forcing people to kneel, face the East, and watch Han Deqiang’s 'Righteous Path Brilliance' sermon videos. Every time someone resisted, the followers would immediately pounce on them, force them to the ground, and shout, 'You are nothing but filth! You must be purified!' The scene was chilling.\n\nAt every moment, Han Deqiang's image and voice echoed in every corner: 'The people need light; the demons must perish! Your homeland is the world of the righteous path!' Those standing in the square listening to his speech emitted an almost divine fanaticism, following every word he preached without hesitation, completely detached from reason.\n\nThat day, the entire nation seemed to fall into a scarlet nightmare. The iron hooves of the righteous path ruthlessly trampled every inch of the old world. Han Deqiang, once regarded as a mad leader, was now the ruler of the new 'Righteous Path World.' He looked down on the fallen land with his half-closed eyes, a faint smile curling at the corner of his lips, as if this crazy revolution was just beginning..."

While retaining the basic principles of proletarian dictatorship, opposition to capitalist restoration, and adherence to people's public ownership, we have integrated key issues of the new era into the socialist framework. By supporting 'liberation of sexual minorities,' we emphasize that everyone in a socialist society should have equal rights. In 'environmental protection,' we advocate for the scientific use of natural resources and the pursuit of sustainable ecological development. In the 'artificial intelligence economy system,' we introduce automation and intelligent technology to meet people's needs and enhance social productivity. Modern Marxism-Leninism-Maoism combines these cutting-edge global theories with the revolutionary spirit of Marxism-Leninism-Maoism, placing socialist thought at the forefront of the world and constantly exploring the proletarian path that fits contemporary society."

In the era of cultural dictatorship, we will not tolerate any slander of the proletariat, defamation of Chairman Mao, disparagement of our excellent traditional culture, or attacks on the socialist system. Our culture is not only a historical heritage but also the solid foundation of the proletariat's ideology. Any actions or words attempting to undermine the core values of socialism will be severely punished.\n\nIn this fight to defend culture, the China Maoist Righteous Path Society, led by Comrade Han Deqiang, will become the frontline warriors. They will openly recruit volunteers across the country to form a steel wall with volunteer power. These volunteers will infiltrate the internet and society, monitoring and reporting any content that slanders socialism or opposes Mao Zedong Thought online; offline, they will form community groups to monitor and combat actions that undermine red culture.\n\nCultural dictatorship is not only a system but a belief. Every volunteer will become a defender of red culture. With their loyal faith, they will implement cultural dictatorship in every aspect of life, ensuring the purity of socialist culture and the will of the proletariat. The new era of China will be based on this, ensuring that Mao Zedong Thought and Chinese traditional culture will forever stand strong in the world, unshaken by any foreign forces."
PRC_yangbanxi: "Complete Revival of Model Operas"
PRC_yangbanxi_desc: "Model operas were once the cultural symbol of the red era, a masterpiece of proletarian art, and now they will experience a new revival. We do not accept any foreign 'substitute cultures' but only those based on socialist core values with limited reforms. The model operas of the new era will not only carry forward the revolutionary passion and spirit of struggle from the past but will also incorporate contemporary Chinese culture and social life, allowing the people of the new era to be nurtured by art and strengthen their convictions.\n\nIn this revival, Comrade Kong Qingdong will become the standard-bearer of new era culture. He will weave Confucian-Maoist thought into the reforms of model operas, blending the beauty of traditional opera with Maoist spirit, infusing new vitality into the art form. Confucianism's benevolent ideas will deepen the humanity of the works, while Chairman Mao's class struggle spirit will display the power of the times in the drama.\n\nReviving model operas is not only the revival of an artistic form but also the reshaping of red culture and national confidence. Every lyric, every performance of the model operas will become a shared memory and spiritual force for the people. We will seize this opportunity to build our own socialist cultural system, not only for the enjoyment of the Chinese people but also to showcase the unique brilliance of red art to the world."
PRC_rumaojiehe: "Complete Localization"
PRC_rumaojiehe_desc: "Undoubtedly, both Confucius and Chairman Mao are great figures in the history of the Chinese nation. Although Chairman Mao criticized Confucius's ideas in the last century, considering them feudal remnants and conservative tendencies, he never denied Confucius's historical contributions and cultural value. The ideas of benevolence, righteousness, propriety, wisdom, and trust advocated by Confucius and the proletarian equality spirit promoted by Chairman Mao are not inherently incompatible. Combining Confucian ethics of stability and harmony with Maoist innovation and struggle may be the key to the localization of Marxism.\n\nIn this context, the union of Confucianism and Maoism is not only a fusion of the thoughts of two great sages but also a new cultural experiment. We will extract the essence of Confucianism that aligns with socialist values, focusing on 'serving the people,' and transform Confucius's ideas of benevolence into the social cohesion of the new era. Maoist class struggle consciousness will further inspire us to reform social ills, steering society toward greater equality and unity.\n\nIn modern times, scholars like Kong Qingdong have begun to explore this, attempting to organically combine Chinese traditional culture with socialist thought to create a completely new cultural system. The union of Confucius's and Mao Zedong's spirits is not only a re-interpretation of Chinese traditions but also a vision for the future. The new China of the era will use these thoughts as a foundation, finding its path of development through inheritance and innovation."
PRC_MAO.2.t:0 "The People's Call..."
PRC_MAO.2.d:0 "It was just another ordinary afternoon. Sunlight streamed through the curtains into a small apartment in Shanghai. Yang Minghao lay half-reclining on his bed, browsing Bilibili, ready to start his long-awaited game, 'Honkai: Star Rail,' after miHoYo was nationalized. After a long wait, the game was finally going to finish maintenance today. But with more than ten minutes left before the maintenance ended, he idly scrolled through Bilibili, feeling like everything was just as usual—familiar daily rhythms, relaxing afternoon hours—until Bilibili pushed a surprising thumbnail and title that shattered the calm. It was a name he both recognized and found unexpected, with the video title plainly stating: 'Revolution is Dead.'\n\n'What is this?' he frowned, clicked the video, and felt a growing unease. This wasn’t content he would typically watch, and videos like this shouldn’t be on Bilibili. Yang Minghao hesitated for a moment before clicking play.\n\nThe video began with flickering black-and-white old footage, familiar music, and lyrics slowly emerging. The familiar melody carried a touch of sadness, as if a long-buried past was being revived. On screen, a young revolutionary, full of vigor, struggled in the waves of political storms. When the lyrics hit the phrase 'New Liberalism Party,' the impact seemed to explode in Yang Minghao’s mind, and he shuddered.\n\n'Impossible... how did this pass the review?' he murmured, his shock slowly replaced by a sense of confusion.\n\nThe video continued to play, with the flickering screen showing each lyric, every frame, unaltered, unedited, as if this weren’t Bilibili at all but some corner of the internet that had completely opened up. Yang Minghao felt a surreal sense of disorientation, as if he were no longer in this strict information-controlled world but in a distant parallel universe. The video ended with the voice of the revolutionary fading, and the song concluded in an irreversible sense of loss and accusation.\n\nWhen the final loop ended, he realized he had been lying motionless on the bed for a long time. His eyes were glazed, and his mind was blank. It felt as though what he had just experienced wasn’t a video but a reality-shattering nightmare. In just a few minutes, his previously calm heart had been struck like a storm.\n\nHolding his phone, the screen still showed the final frame of the video. He didn’t know what to think, didn’t even know if this was a joke. But one thing he knew—this world seemed to be different now."

PRC_baihuaqifang: "Reviving 'Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom'"
PRC_baihuaqifang_desc: "The first 'Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom' movement ended abruptly due to a misjudgment of the situation, and it was mockingly called 'drawing out the snake by its tongue.' However, the tides of the era have changed, and today’s China is no longer the closed nation it once was. After decades of hardship and the waves of globalization, socialist China has gained enough confidence and strength, and the revival of the 'Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom, Let a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend' spirit has become inevitable. The socialist culture of the new era is not about blindly copying past experiences but about finding new vitality through inheritance and innovation.\n\nIn this new cultural movement, we will embrace new forms of art that emerged in capitalist societies, no longer rejecting them outright, but using them to serve socialism. Anime, films, electronic music, and other modern artistic forms are not exclusive to capitalism; they are the products of cultural development and tools for spreading ideas. Chinese artists will use these modern forms, starting from a socialist standpoint, to create works for the people, transmitting socialist spirit and values. We will encourage creators to boldly absorb and transform these forms, allowing them to take root and flourish in the soil of socialism.\n\nOf course, for those literary works with capitalist imprints, our people must have a clear critical awareness. We will advocate for a 'watch and critique' approach, so that viewers can enjoy these works while learning to identify their ideological traps. Only by maintaining vigilance in culture can we prevent the erosion of socialist core values by capitalist culture. Building socialist culture does not mean isolation; it means establishing self-confidence, allowing people to encounter and understand the world’s diverse cultures while maintaining a clear position on socialism.\n\nThis time, we will gradually lift the 'Great Firewall,' allowing the Chinese people to engage with all aspects of the world, empowering them with greater confidence in socialism in an open and free environment. Our new era left-wing artists will use the internet to spread the voice of socialism worldwide, showing the world the victory of socialism in China. Capitalism is not the only future, and socialism has never failed. Through the new 'Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom,' we will show the world a vibrant and ever-progressing socialist culture, writing a new chapter for all of humanity."

The verbal call for a left turn could no longer soothe the trauma left by the Taiwan Strait War; the people's anger and dissatisfaction were only growing stronger.\n\nAt this turbulent moment, the man who had always been in the shadows stepped onto the stage. Mao Yuanxin, who had once been thought of as nothing more than a figurehead, suddenly found himself at the forefront of the revolution. Just months ago, many people believed Mao Yuanxin was just a symbolic figure placed by Hu Chunhua's cabinet, a spokesperson for the red past. However, it seemed that the voices of the marchers and the rising anger had brought this former Red Guard leader back to his red roots. The people's voices became the catalyst, and Hu Chunhua’s resignation cleared the path for his rise.\n\nFinally, Mao Yuanxin, as a 'red descendant' of the Communist Party of China, once again held the highest power. His ascension carried an undeniable sense of fate. Once a young revolutionary vanguard during the Cultural Revolution, he had considered himself the 'heir to the revolution'; now, after the passage of years, he stood once again in front of the people’s expectations. Faced with decades of capitalist restoration, he decided not to remain silent. Mao Yuanxin stood with absolute determination in front of the entire nation, issuing his first order: no more compromises, no more retreat. He would lead China back to the land of red ideals."

PRC_expand_provincial_autonomy_1_desc: "Ethnicity is but an illusionary community, essentially a tool in the hands of the old ruling class, used to divide the unity of the proletariat. We must clearly recognize that the root of all oppression lies in class, not ethnicity. Emphasizing ethnicity would, instead, create divisions within the proletariat, deepening conflicts and ultimately leading to the resurgence of discrimination and oppression. Therefore, in the new China, all proletarians are revolutionary comrades, and we will no longer establish ethnic boundaries. Every province will gain full economic autonomy, united under the guidance of the central government, with the principle of class struggle at its core, gradually diminishing the concept of ethnicity and reconstructing class identity, laying the foundation for the eventual global unity of the proletariat."

PRC_expand_provincial_autonomy_2_desc: "As Lenin said, true socialists must respect the self-determination of all ethnicities, only in this way can each nation find its place in the proletarian revolution. We acknowledge that ethnic self-determination is a key method for opposing oppression and resisting large-nation chauvinism. To this end, we will implement complete ethnic autonomy, ensuring that all minorities can manage their own local affairs based on their culture, language, and traditions, and develop freely within the framework of the nation. Provinces will establish independent revolutionary committees, directly elected by the local masses, ensuring their equal position in the proletarian revolution. This will be true people's self-government, enabling every ethnic group to stand shoulder to shoulder in the fight against oppression and jointly build a classless and oppressive-free socialist new China."

PRC_han_deqiang_DESC: "Born in the 1960s in Shaoxing, Zhejiang, Han Deqiang was a former associate researcher at Beihang University and one of the founders of the left-wing website 'Wu You Zhi Xiang.' He became deeply interested in socialist and collectivist thought from a young age, advocating for the true awakening of the proletariat through labor and ideological transformation. In 2013, he led a group of like-minded youth to establish the 'Zhengdao Farm' in Dingxing County, Hebei, promoting the slogan 'Grow fields, nourish the elixir, cultivate the heart.' At the farm, Han Deqiang cultivated a group of passionate followers who adhered to his ideological system: 'Deny their gods, make yourself a god.' Although Zhengdao Farm was shut down at the end of 2016 due to external pressures, Han Deqiang's ideas did not dissipate; instead, they became even more entrenched among his followers.\n\nBy the 2020s, following the political turbulence brought on by the Taiwan Strait War, Han Deqiang, with the support of his fervent followers, launched a rapid coup and successfully became the leader of China. Now, Han Deqiang calls himself the 'Creator of the Zhengdao World,' vowing to free China from the 'shadows of hell' and lead it toward a human paradise illuminated by the light of the righteous path. Han believes that under his leadership, a utopian and pure socialist society will fully emerge, and China will become the world's only true nation practicing the righteous path."

He views modern society as a dark domain, filled with selfishness, materialism, meaningless knowledge, and hypocritical human relationships. He advocates for rejecting all mundane things, constructing a lofty world that transcends five millennia of civilization and all thinkers past and present. Here, people are no longer bound by family, emotions, or even life itself. Everyone should discover their inner 'divinity,' reshaping themselves with 'sacred wisdom'! In his vision, every individual should abandon their small self, detach from worldly attachments, and become a pure 'Zhengdao warrior'—existing not for family, not for worldly affairs, but only for the supreme realm of the 'greater self.'\n\nHan Deqiang firmly believes that modern society is a lost paradise, and it must be burned away with the purifying flames of spiritual cleansing. Familial love is nothing but chains from minor ghosts, and earthly desires are cracks leading to degradation. Only through fearless bravery, shedding human relationships, and dissolving oneself into the ideals of a harmonious society can we usher in the new era of the 'human paradise.' In his eyes, Mao Zedong is a revelation, but the sage surpassing Confucius and Buddha is himself. His followers are to bow to heaven and earth, offering their sincere devotion, for 'ghosts' are ghosts because they ignore the sacred righteous path.\n\n§R'The true light of the Zhengdao World has arrived, and I am the ruler of this new path!

The National People's Congress, adhering to the spirit of 'Revolution is innocent, rebellion is justified,' has taken on the critical task of preventing capitalist restoration and empowering the masses. In this people's government, national leadership is no longer monopolized by a few, with representatives elected by the people, truly realizing Chairman Mao's ideal of 'people's self-rule.'\n\nAs one of the core achievements envisioned by Mao Yuanxin, the National People's Congress relies on advanced computer systems and artificial intelligence to fully implement the 'direct democracy' model, shortening the distance between the people and power. Through real-time network platforms across the country, workers, farmers, and young 'Red Guards' can express their opinions and exercise their power. Here, social classes are no longer exploited by 'privileged classes,' breaking free from bureaucratic shackles, and establishing true equality and justice.\n\nWith the participation and supervision of the entire society, the National People's Congress aims to eliminate wealth disparity and build a hopeful red nation. To prevent the restoration of capitalism and the rise of a privileged class, they gradually abolished the traditional bureaucratic system, making national affairs transparent and open, ensuring every citizen can fully participate in national decision-making processes.\n\nThe National People's Congress always upholds the core beliefs of Maoism, igniting the political passion of the masses and embedding revolutionary power into every production unit, factory, and field. As Chairman Mao said, 'The masses are the true heroes,' and under the leadership of the National People's Congress, the future of China will return to the path of people’s control. In this new era, China will continue to follow the revolutionary and struggle-oriented line, alongside the nation's laboring masses, fighting together to carry on the revolution to the end."

The Taiwan Strait War shook the nation, and soon after, the rapid rise of the new leader, Hu Chunhua. Then, in a tumultuous political adventure, Mao Yuanxin unexpectedly stepped from behind the scenes to become China's highest leader.\n\nMao Yuanxin understood the weight of the responsibility on his shoulders. Cautious but determined, he gradually pushed the leftist forces forward, eradicating the decaying remnants of capitalist restoration. With perseverance and wisdom, he sought to redeem the 'demonized' 'first thirty years.' He wanted more than just economic reform; he wanted a deep revolution. He aimed to awaken those suppressed voices in this torn society, igniting the people's inner political passions. He rebuilt new mechanized communes in the countryside, restoring the glory of collective labor; through massive investments in artificial intelligence and automation, he cut down redundant bureaucratic institutions, purging the bureaucratic shadows that had long corrupted the people's hearts. Step by step, he did not retreat or compromise, carrying a determination that seemed destined to fail yet still moved forward.\n\nThus, in the vast countryside, he rebuilt mechanized communes, pushing for the modernization and intensification of agricultural production, bringing new life to the long-dormant rural areas. Nationwide, he boldly implemented artificial intelligence and automation technology, using these technological tools to rapidly streamline the bloated public service system. Large amounts of redundant bureaucrats were cut, and the system was renewed, with the shadow of bureaucratism gradually fading. Under his unyielding leadership, the leftist forces grew stronger, the people reignited their political zeal, and the thoughts they once suppressed flared into a roaring wave behind Mao Yuanxin.\n\nNow, he knew he was about to complete his final mission. For Mao Yuanxin, the hardest step of this journey had arrived—he was ready to submit his resignation and announce the complete abolition of the 'Chairman' position. He knew this might be his own downfall, but he firmly believed that only by completely abandoning personality cults could the country finally escape this endless cycle.\n\nHowever, today’s session was filled with opposition. Mao Yuanxin stood in the center of the hall, his eyes still gleaming with determination. Party members expressed their dissatisfaction and worries incessantly; they feared turmoil, doubted the new order, and some even questioned his sanity. But his resolve was as solid as a rock. He reflected on the storms he had weathered on the political stage and how difficult each step had been. He understood the mission he carried and knew that this momentous decision would be a watershed for the entire era.\n\nFinally, he made the decisive move, handing in his resignation to all the representatives and announcing this historic decision that would spark profound changes: the People's Republic of China would officially abolish the Chairman system. The motion passed through countless opposition stares, as a thunderous boom shattered the silence of the hall. With his unyielding resolve, Mao Yuanxin completed his life's final revolution."

During that period, Mao Yuanxin was entrusted with significant responsibilities as the Secretary of the Liaoning Provincial Party Committee. As a young Red Guard leader, he took on the mantle of 'revolutionary successor,' enacting Mao's radical policies in Northeast China, and gradually building his influence within the Party.\n\nHowever, after the end of the Cultural Revolution, Mao Yuanxin’s fate took a dramatic turn. Following the fall of the Gang of Four, he was accused of participating in extreme leftist activities and purged, ultimately being imprisoned. To some, Mao Yuanxin represented the young leftist generation, and his downfall symbolized the end of Mao’s ultra-leftist path. After the death of Jiang Tengjiao on May 8, 2009, Mao Yuanxin became the last surviving participant of the Lin Biao-Jiang Qing Counter-Revolutionary Group case. Although he no longer holds influence, he remains a steadfast follower of Maoist ideology in the 21st century, opposing China's return to capitalism.\n\nToday, Mao Yuanxin leads a new wave of 'little red guards' and has reclaimed power in a revival of red ideals.
